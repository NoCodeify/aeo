# Claude Code Community Business Strategy - Full A-to-Z Plan

## Context

The founder has spent the past year building an entire business infrastructure with Claude Code - 14 agents, 23 skills, 5 MCP servers, a video production pipeline, audit tools, and a full client delivery system - without being a traditional developer. He also built DMChamp, a SaaS generating $100K/yr ARR (~$8.3K/mo), largely maintained by an agentic CI/CD pipeline with minimal founder time (human QA only). He has one existing consulting client (Fuegenix) paying EUR 1,500/mo + 21% VAT (EUR 1,815/mo total, ~$1,900/mo USD) for marketing consulting that now includes AEO. The founder is not starting from $0 - existing revenue is ~$10.2K/mo (DMChamp + Fuegenix) before any new community or high-ticket revenue.

The original plan was to sell AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) as a white-label SaaS (MentionedIn.ai). After deep market research, the Claude Code community + services path offers better founder-market fit, faster time to revenue, a larger market, and lower risk. AEO becomes one service offering in a broader Claude Code implementation business, not a separate company.

### Why Now

The timing is not accidental. Claude Code is the fastest-growing AI product in history ($1B ARR in 6 months). Anthropic hit $9B ARR in 2025 and projects $20-26B in 2026 at a $350B valuation. SemiAnalysis reports that 4% of all public GitHub commits are now authored by Claude Code (Feb 2026), projecting 20%+ of all daily commits by end of 2026. 90-95% of Claude Code itself is written by Claude Code (per Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger). Microsoft adopted Claude Code internally despite selling Copilot. The VS Code Claude Code extension sees 29M daily installs. Collins Dictionary named "vibe coding" the 2025 Word of the Year. Andrej Karpathy coined "agentic engineering" as the successor to vibe coding (Feb 2026). The AI coding tools market is valued at $7.37B in 2025, and the AI code generation market is projected to grow from $4.91B (2024) to $30.1B by 2032. Gartner predicts 60% of new software code will be AI-generated by 2026. Vibe coding startup valuations grew 350% YoY to $36B. 63% of vibe coding users identify as non-developers - and Boris Cherny (head of Claude Code) told Fortune (Jan 24, 2026): "We just want to make it much easier for non-programmers." The demand curve is vertical, and the supply of quality education is near zero.

## 1. POSITIONING

**One-liner:** "Learn Claude Code. Build real systems. Sell implementation services."

**Positioning: KubeCraft Model (Premium Skill + Service Pathway)**

The data says premium pure-skill communities generate serious revenue with far better retention than MMO plays. KubeCraft (Mischa van den Burg) charges $400/mo for DevOps career training, has 857 members, generates ~$343K MRR, and maintains ~92% retention. Compare that to Nick Saraev's Maker School at $184/mo with ~2,100 members and ~$386K MRR - similar revenue, but Saraev self-discloses 20% monthly churn. His second community is literally called "Make Money With Make.com" ($368/mo). His video titles include "How I Made $102,514 Last Month" and "5 Automations You Can Sell For $1,500+." That is MMO positioning.

The unit economics tell the story:
- **MMO (Saraev):** ~$386K MRR but 20% churn. Must constantly backfill 420 members/month just to stay flat. A treadmill.
- **Pure Skill (KubeCraft):** ~$343K MRR with ~8% churn. Loses ~69 members/month. Compounds over time. Sustainable.
- **This community:** Follows the KubeCraft path - premium quality, real skills, no income claims - but with a legitimate service pathway built in.

The community DOES have an MMO element, and it is honest about it: members learn to SELL Claude Code implementation services. This is legitimate because:
- There is real, growing demand for Claude Code setup and customization
- It is a real skill with real deliverables (CLAUDE.md, agents, skills, pipelines)
- The founder has proof of work across multiple verticals
- Members pick their own niche and build their own practice

**The formula: Learn [SKILL] -> Apply to [CONTEXT] -> Sell [SERVICE]**
- "Learn Claude Code -> Build systems for businesses -> Sell implementation at $2-5K/project"
- "Learn Claude Code -> Automate agency delivery -> Handle 5x more clients"
- "Learn Claude Code -> Build your own SaaS -> Hit $100K ARR" (the DMChamp story)
- "Learn Claude Code -> Deliver AEO consulting -> Land retainer clients" (the AEO story)

**What this is NOT:**
- NOT "make $10K/mo with Claude Code" (pure MMO - high churn, unverifiable)
- NOT "build an app and get rich" (Vibe Coding Academy, AI Founders Academy positioning)
- NOT just "learn a skill for productivity" (too boring, low conversion)
- NOT "start an AI agency" (Nate Herk's lane with n8n automations)

**What this IS:**
- Claude Code mastery backed by a real portfolio of production systems
- Premium skill community with a service business pathway
- Multiple tracks: automate your work, build tools, sell services, ship a SaaS
- Every claim backed by ACTUAL projects (DMChamp, agentic pipelines, AEO infrastructure, NFC smart lock)

**The White Space:**
No dedicated Skool community exists for business owners, agency owners, or freelancers who want to use Claude Code to automate their existing workflows - not to start something new. Every existing community is either developer-focused (KubeCraft), MMO-focused ("build an app and get rich"), or general AI automation (n8n-based). The 63% of vibe coding users who are non-developers have nowhere to go for structured, community-based Claude Code education tailored to their existing business. That is the gap this community fills.

**The "Anti-SaaS" Angle (unique positioning nobody else has):**
Every SaaS tool is by definition NOT customizable. You pay $99/mo for software that does 80% of what you need. The other 20%? You are stuck. You need one extra field, one different workflow, one custom integration - and the SaaS says "it's on our roadmap."

With Claude Code, you just BUILD the exact thing you need. Not an approximation. Not a workaround. The EXACT tool, built for YOUR specific workflow, in hours instead of months of waiting.

Content angles:
- "Stop paying $99/mo for tools that don't fit. Build exactly what you need with Claude Code."
- "I replaced 5 SaaS subscriptions with tools I built myself (here's how)"
- "The $300/mo in SaaS I cancelled after learning Claude Code"
- Video: show building a custom CRM/dashboard/reporting tool that beats a generic SaaS

**Target audience (in priority order):**
1. Agency owners (marketing, consulting, creative) - highest willingness to pay
2. Small business owners / solopreneurs - need to do more with less
3. Freelancers / consultants - want to deliver 5x more work
4. Corporate professionals (PMs, marketers, ops) - want career edge
5. Starters / career switchers - want to build without learning to code

**Founder's proof of work (the "receipts"):**

This is what separates the founder from EVERY other Claude Code educator:

1. **DMChamp (SaaS) - $100K/yr ARR** - A revenue-generating SaaS built largely with Claude Code. Not a toy project. Real customers, real revenue.
2. **Agentic CI/CD Pipelines** - Full automated development workflow:
   - Bug detected in code -> triggers ClickUp endpoint -> creates task
   - Claude Code agent orchestration analyzes, investigates, and FIXES the issue
   - Agent reaches out to the customer once fixed
   - Feature requests: customer fills form -> ClickUp -> auto-status updates
   - Agent enters blocked state for human intervention when it cannot fix
   - Development is now largely fully automated (human QA only)
3. **AEO Consulting Infrastructure** - 14 agents, 23 skills, 5 MCP servers, full client delivery pipeline, video production system. An entire consulting business built with Claude Code. One existing client (Fuegenix) receiving AEO as part of a marketing consulting engagement.
4. **Smart Lock NFC Access Control System** - Hardware/firmware project: battery-less NFC lock, phone charges the lock via NFC, performs authentication and validation to lock/unlock/reject. Proves Claude Code works beyond software.
5. **Markdown to PowerPoint Tool** - Developer tool that converts MD to PPTX
6. **Cold Email Personalization** - Automated fully personalized messages for lead lists
7. **Content & Marketing Systems** - YouTube strategy, LinkedIn content strategy, landing pages - all built/planned with Claude Code

Nobody else in the Claude Code education space has this breadth:
- Samin has BookedIn.ai (one SaaS)
- Alex Finn has Creator Buddy (one app, $300K ARR) and ~110K YouTube subscribers
- The founder has: a SaaS ($100K ARR) + agentic CI/CD + hardware project + consulting infrastructure + dev tools + marketing automation

**Competitive positioning:**
| Competitor | YouTube | Their angle | Your angle |
|-----------|--------|------------|------------|
| Samin (Claude Co-workers, $49/mo) | ~17K subs | Claude for SaaS founders | Claude for ALL professionals (with real $100K SaaS as proof) |
| Alex Finn (Vibe Coding Academy, $97/mo) | ~110K subs | Build a $300K app (MMO) | Be better at your current work (not just apps) |
| Chris Ashby (AI Founders, $59-67/mo) | ~34K subs | Idea to app in 28 days (MMO) | Amplify what you already do |
| Nate Herk (AIS Plus, $99/mo) | - | n8n automations for clients | Claude Code depth (agents, agentic pipelines, CLAUDE.md systems) |
| Zac Frulloni (Vibe Coding School, $447/mo) | - | Pure MMO, high-ticket vibe coding | Real systems, real business results (not income promises) |
| Liam Ottley (AAA Accelerator) | 731K subs | AI agency business model | Not competing directly - different tool (n8n vs Claude Code) |
| KubeCraft (Mischa, $400/mo) | 78K subs | DevOps career training | Broader: any professional, not just DevOps |
| Free courses (Anthropic, Coursera, etc.) | N/A | Self-paced tutorials | Community + coaching + done-with-you + REAL production systems to study |

**Thought leaders building toward communities (potential future competitors or collaborators):**
- **Carl Vellotti** - Free "CC for Everyone" + "CC for PMs" courses, 7,394 total Maven students across courses (2,000+ PMs completed the PM-specific course). Innovative approach (learn CC inside CC). Building toward community but hasn't launched a paid Skool yet.
- **Teresa Torres** - 7-part series on CC for non-technical people, manages her life with two CC terminals. Strong non-dev angle but no community yet.
- **Dan Shipper (Every.to)** - "Claude Code Camp" live events, ~400 attendees per session. Newsletter + events model, not Skool.
- **Francesca Tabor** - "Claude Code for Business" book. Book model, not community.

These creators validate the non-developer CC market but have not launched paid communities. They could become competitors if they do, or collaboration partners (guest workshops, cross-promotion).

## 2. BUSINESS MODEL - FOUR LAYERS

The critical insight: high-ticket comes FIRST. You do not need an audience to sell implementation services on LinkedIn. You need a portfolio and a pitch. YouTube and community come in parallel but take months to compound.

### Layer 1: High-Ticket LinkedIn Offer ($2,500-5,000) - MONTH 1

- **Purpose:** Immediate revenue, case studies, proof of results
- **Format:** Done-with-you Claude Code implementation (NOT done-for-you)
- **No audience required.** Portfolio is the pitch. LinkedIn outreach starts Day 1.
- **Deliverable in 2 weeks:**
  1. Audit their business workflows (what they do daily/weekly)
  2. Build their custom CLAUDE.md (Claude Code learns their business)
  3. Create 3-5 custom agents for their specific workflows
  4. Set up their project structure, skills, and slash commands
  5. 2x 90-minute live sessions (screen-share, build together)
  6. 30 days of async support in a private channel
- **Target:** 2-3 clients/month via LinkedIn
- **Revenue:** $5,000-15,000/mo

**LinkedIn outreach sequence:**
1. Engage with target's content for 3-5 days
2. Connect: "Noticed you run [type of business]. Following your journey."
3. Value-first DM: "I use Claude Code to automate about 80% of my [relevant workflow]. I noticed [specific thing about their business] - I think you could save 20+ hours/week. Want me to show you a quick demo?"
4. Follow-up: 60-second Loom showing Claude Code doing something specific to their industry
5. CTA: "I do done-with-you setups for businesses like yours. Want to chat for 15 min?"

**Future high-ticket evolution (Month 6+):**
- Team training workshops: $5-10K per engagement (5-20 people, 2-day intensive)
- Small group cohort: $2,500 per person, 4-week sprint, 8-10 people
- Monthly retainer: $500-1,000/mo ongoing advisory

### Layer 2: YouTube (Awareness Engine + Free Content) - MONTH 1, PARALLEL

- **Cost:** Free
- **Purpose:** Build audience, establish authority, drive to paid Skool
- **CTA on every video:** "Join Claudify" (paid Skool link)
- **Starts Month 1** but takes 3-6 months to compound. Not the revenue driver early on.
- **YouTube IS the free tier.** No free Skool community. All community content is behind $97/mo.

### Layer 3: Paid Skool Community ($97/month) - MONTH 3-4

- **Purpose:** Core recurring revenue (launches when YouTube has traction)
- **Target:** 50-100 members by Month 5, 200-400 by Month 9
- **Pricing tiers:**
  - **Standard:** $97/mo (core access)
  - **Annual:** $970/yr (~17% discount) - locks in retention, reduces churn significantly
  - **Future VIP (Month 6+):** $297/mo, limited to 20 seats - small group coaching, personalized project reviews, direct founder access. Mirrors KubeCraft's ascension model ($47/mo -> $99/mo -> $4,800/yr application-only).
- **Unit economics:** At $97/mo with 10% churn: LTV = $970. At 5% churn (achievable with annual pricing): LTV = $1,940.
- **What's inside:**
  - **21-Day Quick Start (6 modules, the onboarding path):**
    - Module 1: Welcome + Setup
    - Module 2: Your First Session
    - Module 3: CLAUDE.md: Your Project's Brain
    - Module 4: Your First Real System (the key module - members build ONE real thing)
    - Module 5: When Things Go Wrong
    - Module 6: Pick Your Track
  - **FoundationKit (added 1-2/month based on demand):**
    - Module 7: Custom Slash Commands & Skills
    - Module 8: Building Agents
    - Module 9: MCP Servers
    - Module 10: Multi-Agent Teams
    - Module 11: Hooks & Automation Triggers
    - Module 12: Claude Code for Research & Analysis
    - Module 13: Claude Code for Content & Marketing
    - Module 14: Building Internal Tools & Dashboards
    - Module 15: Advanced Patterns (git worktrees, parallel sessions)
  - **CaseStudyOS (released 1 per month):**
    - CS1: DMChamp - $100K SaaS lifecycle
    - CS2: Agentic CI/CD Pipeline
    - CS3: AEO Consulting Business
    - CS4: NFC Smart Lock
    - CS5: Video Production & Outreach Stack
  - **ServiceKit (for Track C members):**
    - SK1: The Claude Code Service Menu
    - SK2: Scoping & Discovery
    - SK3: Pricing & Packaging
    - SK4: Client Delivery
    - SK5: Finding & Closing Clients
  - **The Vault:** CLAUDE.md templates, agent configs, skill templates, project starters
  - **Weekly live coaching call** (screen-share, build together, debug live)
  - **Template library:** CLAUDE.md templates, agent templates, skill templates for different industries
  - **1-on-1 implementation help** (async in community, not unlimited calls)
  - **Monthly masterclass:** Deep dive on one topic (e.g., "Building MCP Servers from Scratch")
  - **Private channel:** Paid members only, higher signal

**21-Day Milestone:**
- "Build your first working Claude Code system in 21 days" - a structured onboarding path, not a refund promise
- The 21-Day Quick Start (6 modules) + weekly coaching calls + founder DM check-ins at Day 7 and Day 14
- NOT a refund guarantee. It is a milestone: follow the path, do the work, have a working system by Day 21

**Retention mechanisms:**
- **Weekly live coaching calls** - universally cited as the #1 retention driver in every successful Skool community. Screen-share, debug live, build together.
- 21-day Quick Start milestone (structured onboarding path with founder check-ins)
- Leaderboard + gamification (Skool built-in) - communities report 3-4x increase in daily posts after leaderboard contests
- Progressive content unlocks tied to engagement levels
- Weekly Loom updates showing what YOU built that week with Claude Code
- Monthly "what members built" showcase
- Member case studies (once they build real things, feature them)
- Annual pricing option ($970/yr) dramatically reduces churn by locking members in

**Multiple outcome tracks within the community:**
- Track A: "Automate Your Work" - for employed professionals, agency owners
- Track B: "Build Your Tool" - for people who want to ship a SaaS/product
- Track C: "Sell Implementation Services" - for people who want a service business (AEO is one template, others pick their own niche)
- Members self-select. Everyone learns Claude Code foundations, then specializes.

**The "Coach Teaching Consultants" Flywheel:**

This is the MMO element, done honestly:

"I'll teach you how to sell Claude Code implementation services for $2-5K/project. Here are proven service packages. I built all of them. Here's the client delivery system. Here are the templates."

The flywheel:
1. Sell Claude Code implementations to businesses (high-ticket)
2. Document every engagement as content
3. Teach community members to sell the same service
4. They serve different niches (one does law firms, another does ecom, another does marketing agencies)
5. Their wins become your case studies
6. Case studies attract more members

This works because:
- Claude Code implementation is genuinely in demand
- The skills are real and transferable
- The founder has proof of work across multiple verticals
- Members are not competing with each other (different niches)

### Community Differentiation: Why Pay $97/mo?

Why would someone pay $97/mo instead of watching free YouTube tutorials and reading Anthropic docs?

**What free resources give you:**
- Self-paced tutorials (Anthropic's 21 lessons, Coursera, Scrimba)
- Text-based guides (docs, blog posts, Reddit)
- General-purpose AI courses (not business-specific)
- No accountability, no community, no feedback

**What $97/mo gives you that free cannot:**

1. **Live weekly coaching calls** - Screen-share your actual project, get real-time help debugging and building. This is the #1 retention driver in every successful Skool community.
2. **Production-grade templates** - Not "hello world" examples. Actual CLAUDE.md files, agent configs, skill templates, and MCP server setups from a $100K SaaS and a consulting business. You cannot get these from a tutorial.
3. **Business-specific use case library** - Client onboarding automation, proposal generation, SOPs, content pipelines, financial reporting. Not generic coding exercises.
4. **Accountability + community** - Weekly challenges, leaderboard, monthly showcases. You build things, not just watch videos.
5. **The "middle layer"** - More advanced than beginner tutorials, less technical than developer docs. Specifically designed for business owners who want to USE Claude Code, not become programmers.
6. **Direct access to someone who has done it** - The founder built a $100K SaaS, agentic CI/CD, a hardware project, and a 14-agent consulting system. That experience is not available in any free course.

**The value proposition in one sentence:** "Anthropic teaches you what Claude Code can do. We teach you how to make it work for YOUR specific business."

---

## 3. YOUTUBE CONTENT STRATEGY

### Channel Positioning
- **Channel name:** [TBD - founder's personal brand or "Claude Code [something]"]
- **Tagline:** Teaching professionals how to use Claude Code to automate their work
- **Differentiator:** Every video uses REAL systems the founder built. Not theoretical. Not "hello world" demos.

### YouTube Landscape

Only 5-8 creators consistently make Claude Code content. View potential: 20K-90K+ for established channels. Current players and verified data:
- **Alex Finn:** ~110K subs, 196 videos, 89.5K avg views, self-proclaimed "#1 vibe coding channel"
- **Peter Yang:** 60.7K subs, "15-minute build" format confirmed as his most engaging content
- **Key insight:** "vibe coding tutorial" keyword is dominated by Cursor/Windsurf content, NOT Claude Code. This is a clear opportunity.

### Three Content Pillars (40/40/20 split)

**Pillar 1: Trending AI + Claude Code Angle (40%)**
- Purpose: Views, subscribers, algorithm growth
- Expected views: 10K-100K+
- Examples:
  - "Claude Code Just Hit $1 Billion - Here's What Nobody Tells You"
  - "Anthropic's New [Feature] Changes Everything for Non-Developers"
  - "I Tested Claude Code vs [Competitor] - Honest Results"
  - "The Tool That Replaced My Entire Team" (hook-driven, trending format)
  - React to Claude Code news with your unique "built a business with it" lens

**Pillar 2: Search-Targeted Tutorial Content (40%)**
- Purpose: Evergreen traffic, authority, searchable library
- Expected views: 1K-10K (consistent, compounding)
- Target keywords:
  | Keyword | Volume | Title |
  |---------|--------|-------|
  | claude code tutorial | HIGH | "Claude Code Tutorial: Complete Beginner's Guide (2026)" |
  | claude code for beginners | HIGH | "Claude Code for Non-Developers: Start Here" |
  | how to use claude code | HIGH | "How to Use Claude Code (Step-by-Step for Non-Coders)" |
  | claude code vs cursor | MED | "Claude Code vs Cursor: Which Should You Use?" |
  | claude code tips | MED | "10 Claude Code Tips That Changed How I Work" |
  | vibe coding tutorial | MED | "Vibe Coding: Build Real Tools Without Writing Code" |
  | claude code agents | LOW-MED | "Claude Code Agents: Build Your AI Team" |
  | claude code mcp | LOW-MED | "MCP Servers Explained: Connect Claude Code to Anything" |
  | CLAUDE.md | LOW | "CLAUDE.md: The File That Makes Claude Code 10x Smarter" |

**Pillar 3: Case Study / Conversion Content (20%)**
- Purpose: Skool signups, high-ticket conversions
- Expected views: 500-5K (low volume, high conversion)
- Examples (each based on REAL projects the founder built):
  - "I Built a $100K SaaS With Claude Code (DMChamp Breakdown)"
  - "My AI Fixes Its Own Bugs and Emails the Customer (Agentic Pipeline Demo)"
  - "Claude Code Automated My Entire Development Process (Here's How)"
  - "I Built a Smart Lock System With Claude Code (Hardware + Software)"
  - "5 Claude Code Systems Running My Business Right Now"
  - "How I Built an AI Audit System Without Writing Code (AEO Case Study)"
  - "The CLAUDE.md File That Runs My Business"
  - "I Built 14 AI Agents That Run My Consulting Business"
  - "How Claude Code Replaced a $5K/Month Developer"

### Verified Content Gaps (all 6 still open as of Feb 2026)

1. **Multi-agent orchestration tutorials** - MAJOR GAP. Nobody teaching this.
2. **MCP server setup guides** - HIGH. Setup complexity is where people quit.
3. **Non-developer Claude Code workflows** - GROWING. Fortune/Lenny validated demand.
4. **Context management at scale** - CRITICAL. Common Reddit complaint.
5. **Hooks & advanced automation** - MEDIUM-HIGH.
6. **"15-minute build" format** - PROVEN. Peter Yang's most engaging format.

### First 10 Videos (Weeks 1-10)

| Week | Title | Pillar | Expected | Why |
|------|-------|--------|----------|-----|
| 1 | "I Built a $100K SaaS With Claude Code (No Coding Background)" | Case study | 10K-50K | Origin story + proof. DMChamp is the hook. |
| 2 | "Claude Code Tutorial: The Only Guide Non-Developers Need (2026)" | Search | 5K-20K | Evergreen search traffic, establishes authority |
| 3 | [React to trending Claude/AI news with your angle] | Trending | 10K-100K | Algorithm boost, ride the wave |
| 4 | "My AI Fixes Its Own Bugs and Emails Customers (Full Demo)" | Case study | 5K-30K | Jaw-dropping content. Agentic pipeline demo. |
| 5 | "Claude Code vs Cursor vs Copilot: Honest Comparison" | Search/trending | 10K-50K | High search volume comparison keyword |
| 6 | "CLAUDE.md: The File That Makes Claude Code 10x Better" | Search | 2K-10K | Unique tutorial nobody else makes |
| 7 | [Trending topic] | Trending | 10K-100K | Algorithm boost |
| 8 | "I Built a Smart Lock With Claude Code (Not Just Software)" | Case study | 5K-20K | Pattern interrupt - hardware + Claude Code = unique |
| 9 | "How I Built 14 AI Agents That Run My Business" | Case study/conversion | 2K-10K | Deep showcase, drives to community |
| 10 | "How to Sell AI Services Using Claude Code (AEO Case Study)" | Conversion | 2K-5K | For members who want to monetize - AEO as one example |

### YouTube-to-Skool Conversion Tactics

Three proven models with real data:

1. **"Incomplete Tutorial" (Rourke Heath model)** - The Zeigarnik Effect. Give 30 minutes of genuine, valuable tutorial on YouTube. Mention the complete workflow, templates, and support live in the community. Rourke has only ~10K YouTube subscribers but converts to 439 paid Skool members at $97/mo (~$42.6K MRR). Proof you do NOT need a massive following.
2. **"Template Giveaway" (Nate Herk model)** - Free downloads (CLAUDE.md templates, cheat sheets, starter kits) available as lead magnets. The download is the hook, the paid community CTA is the next step.
3. **"Video Notes" (Julian Goldie model)** - Notes, resources, and links from the video available as a free download with CTA to the paid community. Low-friction lead capture.

The founder should use a hybrid of all three: Zeigarnik for case study videos (Pillar 3), template giveaways for tutorial videos (Pillar 2), and video notes for trending content (Pillar 1). All CTAs drive to the paid Skool directly (no free tier).

### Non-Developer Content Angles

63% of vibe coding users are non-developers. Their specific pain points are high-value content topics:

1. **Terminal anxiety** - The #1 barrier to adoption. "How to stop being scared of the terminal" is a video that writes itself.
2. **The word "Code" itself** - The name is a barrier. Content should reframe: "You don't write code. You describe what you want."
3. **Installation friction** - Node.js, paths, permissions, environment variables. A hand-holding setup video would get massive search traffic.
4. **Context management confusion** - CLAUDE.md, compacting, context windows. Non-devs do not intuit this.
5. **Confidence gap** - AI writes broken code, and non-devs cannot tell. Teaching "how to verify Claude Code's work" is a unique angle nobody covers.

### CTA Structure (every video)
- Mid-roll: "If you want to learn this, I teach it step-by-step inside Claudify - link in description"
- End screen: "Join [X] professionals already learning Claude Code" (paid Skool link)
- Pinned comment: Community link + "What would YOU automate with Claude Code?"

---

## 4. LINKEDIN STRATEGY

### Target: Business owners, agency owners, consultants (decision-makers with budget)

### Post Types (3-5 posts/week)
| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Wake-up call | Text + screenshot | "My client was paying a developer $3K/month. I built the same tool with Claude Code in 2 hours." |
| Before/after | Carousel | "What my workflow looked like before vs after Claude Code" |
| Tutorial snippet | Short video (60s) | Screen recording of Claude Code doing something impressive |
| Data/insight | Text post | "I tracked my hours for 30 days. Claude Code saved me 23 hours/week." |
| Case study | Text post | "How I built [specific thing] in [time] with Claude Code" |

### Outreach Flow (for high-ticket)
1. Engage with target's posts (3-5 days)
2. Connect with genuine message
3. Value DM: specific observation about their business + "Claude Code can automate this"
4. 60-second Loom demo tailored to their use case
5. 15-minute call -> close done-with-you package

### Content Rule
- Every LinkedIn post should make the reader think: "I need to learn this tool"
- Never sell the community directly. Sell the RESULT. Community is just where they learn it.

## 5. WHAT HAPPENS TO AEO

AEO is NOT paused. It is NOT killed. It becomes ONE SERVICE in a broader Claude Code implementation menu.

### The Service Menu

The founder sells Claude Code implementation services. AEO is one package. The full menu:

| Service | What the client gets | Example deliverable |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **AEO / AI visibility** | Audits, optimization, monitoring | 14-agent audit system, playbooks, content optimization |
| **Internal automation** | CLAUDE.md, custom agents, skills for their workflows | Custom agent team for their specific business processes |
| **Agentic pipelines** | Bug detection -> auto-fix -> customer notification | CI/CD automation like the founder's own system |
| **Content systems** | Video pipeline, lead gen, marketing automation | YouTube production pipeline, LinkedIn content system |

The founder has one existing client (Fuegenix) paying EUR 1,500/mo + 21% VAT (~$1,900/mo USD) for marketing consulting that now includes AEO. That is proof the model works. The goal is to add more clients across all four service categories.

### AEO Inside the Community

The community angle: teach people to pick a niche and sell Claude Code implementation services. AEO is one template. Someone else might do Claude Code for law firms, ecom, real estate, healthcare, etc.

Specifically, AEO serves as:

1. **Case study module** in the paid Skool community (Module 16: "How I Built an Entire AEO Consulting Business with Claude Code") - shows the FULL journey from zero to functioning business
2. **Service template** - For members who want a service business, AEO demonstrates: "Here's what a real Claude Code service engagement looks like. Here are the agents. Here's the client delivery pipeline. Here are the templates. Now adapt this for YOUR niche."
3. **YouTube content** - "I Built an AI Audit System Without Writing Code" is compelling. So is "How I Deliver Consulting Projects Using Only Claude Code (AEO Case Study)"
4. **Proof of expertise** - 14 agents, 23 skills, 5 MCP servers, client delivery pipeline = the most impressive Claude Code portfolio anyone has. AEO is the PROOF, not the product.
5. **Future SaaS option** - MentionedIn.ai can be built later as a community build-along project. Members watch you build it live. That becomes months of content AND a product.
6. **High-ticket demonstration** - When selling done-with-you packages on LinkedIn, the AEO system demonstrates what is possible ("I built all of this with Claude Code, let me build YOUR system")

### The AEO Methodology as Template

The AEO methodology itself (3,771-line SOP, audit tools, playbook system) becomes a template that community members can study, fork, and adapt for their own consulting niches. Someone in the community could take the same approach for SEO, PPC, social media, or any other service vertical - using Claude Code to build their delivery infrastructure. The 14-agent system is the blueprint. The methodology is the example. Claude Code is the tool.

## 6. PRICING SUMMARY

| Layer | Price | Timeline | Target Members | Revenue |
|-------|-------|----------|---------------|---------|
| High-ticket (LinkedIn) | $2,500-5,000 | Month 1 | 2-3/month | $5,000-15,000/mo |
| YouTube | Free | Month 1 | Growth engine (this IS the free content) | $0 (drives everything) |
| Paid Skool (Monthly) | $97/mo | Month 3-4 | 100+ by Month 6 | $9,700+/mo |
| Paid Skool (Annual) | $970/yr (~$81/mo) | Month 3-4 | Included above | ~17% discount, better retention |
| VIP Tier (Future) | $297/mo | Month 6+ | Limited to 20 seats | Up to $5,940/mo |
| **Total Month 6** | | | | **$16,760/mo** (conservative, excl. VIP) |

**Pricing evolution model (follows KubeCraft):** KubeCraft started at $47/mo, raised to $99/mo, then shifted to $4,800/yr with an application-only model. This community starts at $97/mo, introduces annual at launch, and adds a VIP tier at Month 6+ once there is enough demand and social proof to justify $297/mo.

## 7. COST STRUCTURE & BREAK-EVEN

| Expense | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Claude Max subscription | $100-200 | Pro ($100) or Max ($200) plan for daily use |
| Skool Pro plan | $99 | Required for paid tiers |
| Claude Code API | $200-500 | For demos, client work, content production |
| Video production tools | $50-100 | Editing software, thumbnail tools |
| LinkedIn Sales Navigator | $100 | For outreach (optional) |
| Lead magnet hosting | $0-30 | Gumroad or similar |
| Domain/email | $20 | Professional email |
| **Total monthly nut** | **$570-1,050** | |

**Break-even:** 6-11 paid Skool members at $97/mo, or 1 high-ticket client covers ~2.5-5 months of costs.

This is an extremely low-overhead business model. No employees, no office, no inventory, no VC. The founder's own Claude Code infrastructure (video pipeline, content systems, agent teams) reduces production time significantly - this is both a competitive advantage and proof of concept for what the community teaches.

## 8a. THE 0-TO-1 PLAYBOOK

The 90-day plan above assumes the machine is running. This section addresses the cold start problem - how to get the first subscribers, members, and clients when starting from zero.

### First 50 YouTube Subscribers

- Cross-post clips to Reddit (r/ClaudeCode, r/SideProject, r/artificial, r/nocode) with genuine value - not self-promotion spam
- Share clips on X/Twitter tagging relevant people (Lenny Rachitsky, Peter Yang, Andrej Karpathy, relevant AI accounts)
- Post in existing free Skool communities (Liam Ottley's 292K free members, Nate Herk's 255K free members) with genuine value-add content
- LinkedIn posts that link to YouTube (every LinkedIn post should drive to the latest video)
- The Rourke Heath proof point: even 10K subscribers can convert to 400+ paid community members. Subscriber count is a vanity metric - conversion rate is what matters.

### First 50 Paid Skool Members

- YouTube CTA on every video drives directly to paid Skool (mid-roll + end screen + pinned comment + description link)
- Lead magnet: "Claude Code Starter Kit" (CLAUDE.md template + cheat sheet) as a free download, with CTA to join the community for the full curriculum
- Cross-promote in relevant AI communities with genuine helpful posts (not "join my community" spam)
- Rourke Heath's Zeigarnik tactic: give 30 minutes of genuine tutorial on YouTube, mention the complete workflow and templates live in the community
- Founding member pricing ($67/mo for first 20 members, locked in permanently) creates urgency

### First High-Ticket Client (Non-Fuegenix)

- LinkedIn DMs to warm connections first (people who already know the founder from the tech/marketing world)
- Offer first 1-2 engagements at a discount ($1,500-2,000) in exchange for detailed case studies and testimonials
- 60-second Loom demos tailored to each prospect's specific industry and workflows
- Target: agency owners and consultants who are already paying for tools/services that Claude Code could replace
- The portfolio IS the pitch - the founder's existing projects (DMChamp, AEO, CI/CD) are the sales collateral

### First 10 Paid Skool Members

- Offer early-bird "founding member" pricing ($67/mo for the first 20 members, locked in permanently)
- Personal outreach to the most engaged YouTube viewers and LinkedIn connections
- "Founding member" positioning: help shape the curriculum, get direct access to the founder, have input on what gets built
- The first 10 members are the seed of the culture. Handpick them.

## 8b. TIME ALLOCATION

### Month 1-3 (Building Phase)

| Activity | Hours/week | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| High-ticket client work | 15-20 | 2 clients x 8-10 hrs each |
| YouTube content creation | 10-15 | Scripting, recording, editing (1 video/week) |
| LinkedIn content + outreach | 5-8 | 5 posts/week + DM conversations |
| Community management | 3-5 | Skool: posts, replies, Looms (pre-launch prep) |
| Admin/planning | 2-3 | |
| **Total** | **35-51** | Manageable for a solo founder |

### Month 4-6 (Scaling Phase)

| Activity | Hours/week | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| High-ticket client work | 15-20 | |
| YouTube content creation | 10-15 | |
| LinkedIn content + outreach | 5-8 | |
| Community management | 8-12 | Paid tier adds coaching calls, more engagement |
| Weekly coaching call | 2 | Live session + prep |
| Admin/planning | 2-3 | |
| **Total** | **42-60** | Gets heavy - see hiring milestone below |

**First hire:** At $10K+/mo revenue (Month 4-5 target), hire a part-time video editor ($500-1,000/mo) to reclaim 5-8 hrs/week. This is the first hire. It keeps the founder focused on high-value activities (client work, coaching calls, community engagement) while the most time-consuming production task gets delegated.

**Key insight:** The founder's own Claude Code infrastructure (video pipeline, content systems, agent teams) reduces production time significantly. YouTube scripts, LinkedIn posts, client deliverables, and community content can all be partially automated with the same tools being taught in the community. This is both a competitive advantage and proof of concept - the founder uses the product every day to run the business that sells the product.

## 9. BRAND ARCHITECTURE

| Element | Name/Domain | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Personal brand | YouTube + LinkedIn | Content + authority + lead gen |
| High-ticket offer | Via LinkedIn | Premium implementation service (Layer 1 revenue) |
| YouTube | Free content | Top of funnel (replaces free Skool tier) |
| Paid community | Skool ($97/mo) | Core recurring revenue, education, coaching |
| AEO methodology | The AEO Protocol | One service package + case study module |
| Future SaaS | MentionedIn.ai | Community build-along project (Month 6+) |

**Community name:** Requires dedicated brainstorming session. Key criteria: (1) not tied to "Claude" brand for future-proofing, (2) memorable and ownable, (3) communicates the skill-to-service pathway. Placeholder until decided.

---

## 10. KEY RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Platform risk (tied to Anthropic) | We are betting on Claude Code's continued growth. CLAUDE.md, MCP, hooks, and agents are Anthropic-specific and do not transfer directly to Cursor or Copilot. If the market shifts, we pivot the curriculum - the community and personal brand survive because the audience trusts the founder, not because the content is platform-agnostic. Karpathy's "agentic engineering" framing provides a broader conceptual umbrella if needed. |
| Claude Code becomes too easy | Go deeper: agents, MCP, multi-agent systems, enterprise workflows. Basics commoditize, advanced does not. |
| Nate Herk or others enter the space | They cannot match the founder's depth (year of production use, 14 agents, 23 skills, 5 MCP servers). They are tourists, the founder is a resident. |
| Content treadmill burnout | Batch record, use Claude Code to produce faster, build content systems (the video pipeline already exists) |
| High-ticket pipeline stalls | Community becomes the flywheel - paid members refer their network. Also: YouTube -> Skool -> high-ticket is a proven funnel. |
| Free courses undercut paid | Free courses are self-paced and impersonal. Community + coaching + accountability is the premium. Anthropic's free course is GOOD - it creates demand. |
| Revenue gap before community compounds | High-ticket fills this. $2,500-5,000 per client from Month 1, no audience needed. |

## 10a. DECISION POINTS & METRICS

Specific checkpoints to evaluate progress and course-correct early.

### Progress Metrics

| Metric | Week 4 check | Week 8 check | Week 12 check |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| YouTube subscribers | 100+ | 500+ | 1,000+ |
| YouTube avg views (last 5 videos) | 500+ | 1,000+ | 2,500+ |
| Paid Skool members | - | - | 20+ |
| High-ticket conversations started | 10+ | 25+ | 40+ |
| High-ticket clients closed | 0-1 | 2-3 total | 4-6 total |
| LinkedIn connections (target audience) | 100+ | 300+ | 500+ |

### Course Corrections

**If YouTube is below targets at Week 8:**
- Analyze which videos performed best and double down on that format
- Increase LinkedIn cross-promotion
- Consider paid promotion ($200-500/mo) on best-performing video
- Post short-form clips on TikTok/Instagram Reels
- Revisit thumbnails and titles (these account for 80%+ of click-through rate)

**If high-ticket is not closing by Week 8:**
- Lower price to $1,500 for first 2 clients (case study pricing)
- Shift from cold outreach to warm network (people who already know the founder)
- Create a productized service offer (fixed scope, fixed price, no custom scoping)
- Consider a "mini engagement" at $500-1,000 as a foot-in-the-door offer

**If Skool sign-ups are below target at Week 12:**
- Survey existing members: what would make them stay/recommend?
- Add more exclusive content or increase coaching frequency
- Run a limited-time founding member offer
- Consider lowering price to $49/mo to test price sensitivity
- Review YouTube-to-Skool conversion rate and optimize CTAs

## 11. REVENUE PROJECTIONS

### Conservative (Month 1-12)

| Month | High-Ticket | Paid Skool | Total MRR |
|-------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | 1 x $3K = $3,000 | 0 | $3,000 |
| 2 | 2 x $3K = $6,000 | 0 | $6,000 |
| 3 | 2 x $3K = $6,000 | 10 x $97 = $970 | $6,970 |
| 4 | 2 x $3K = $6,000 | 25 x $97 = $2,425 | $8,425 |
| 5 | 3 x $3K = $9,000 | 50 x $97 = $4,850 | $13,850 |
| 6 | 3 x $3K = $9,000 | 80 x $97 = $7,760 | $16,760 |
| 9 | 3 x $4K = $12,000 | 200 x $97 = $19,400 | $31,400 |
| 12 | 4 x $5K = $20,000 | 350 x $97 = $33,950 | $53,950 |

*Assumes 8% monthly churn on Skool (KubeCraft benchmark), growing high-ticket average as portfolio develops. High-ticket revenue is lumpy but recurring via retainers at Month 6+.*

Note: High-ticket numbers reflect individual engagements, not monthly recurring. Some clients convert to retainers ($500-1,000/mo) which adds recurring base over time.

**Existing revenue baseline (not included in projections above):** DMChamp generates ~$8.3K/mo ($100K/yr ARR), largely maintained by the agentic CI/CD pipeline with minimal founder time. Fuegenix pays ~$1.9K/mo for marketing consulting. Combined existing revenue: ~$10.2K/mo. This means at Month 1, total actual revenue is ~$13.2K/mo ($10.2K existing + $3K new high-ticket), not $3K.

### Reference Models

**KubeCraft (primary reference - premium skill):**
- 857 members at $400/mo = ~$343K MRR
- Took ~2 years to reach this level
- ~92% retention (8% churn)
- 78K YouTube subscribers (YouTube as growth channel for technical skill community)
- Pricing evolution: started at $47/mo -> raised to $99/mo -> shifted to $4,800/yr with application-only model
- Proves premium technical skill communities generate serious revenue
- Pure skill positioning, no income claims

**Rourke Heath (most relevant reference - small YouTube, high conversion):**
- Only ~10K YouTube subscribers
- 439 paid Skool members at $97/mo = ~$42.6K MRR
- Tactic: the "Zeigarnik Effect" - give 30 minutes of genuine tutorial on YouTube, mention the complete workflow lives in the community
- Proves you do NOT need a massive YouTube following to build a successful paid community
- Most relevant comparison because he operates at a similar scale and price point to the founder's target

**Stephen G. Pope (mid-scale reference):**
- 74.5K YouTube subscribers
- 13.8K free Skool members, ~400 paid at $97/mo = ~$39.8K MRR
- Conversion rate from free to paid: ~2.9%
- Demonstrates the YouTube -> free Skool -> paid Skool funnel at scale

**Conversion benchmarks:**
- Nate Herk: 241K free -> 3.5K paid = ~1.6% conversion rate
- Small Skool communities (<1K members) get 2.10% engagement vs 0.23% for 10K+ members
- Smaller communities convert better on a percentage basis

**Evolve (aspirational reference):**
- ~1,200 members at $1,250/mo = ~$1.5M MRR
- Proves ultra-premium Skool pricing works
- Network access + mentorship model

## 12. IMPLEMENTATION: WHAT TO CREATE

### Documents to write:
1. **New business strategy document** (`systems/claude-code-community-strategy.md`) - this plan, formalized
2. **Update MEMORY.md** - reflect the new direction
3. ~~**Skool community outline**~~ - DONE: see `claudify-community-plan.md` (launch content, monthly roadmap, onboarding flow, retention mechanics)
4. **YouTube content calendar** - first 12 videos with titles, keywords, scripts
5. **LinkedIn content templates** - 10 post templates ready to customize
6. **High-ticket offer page** - one-pager describing the done-with-you package
7. **Lead magnet** - "Claude Code Starter Kit" (CLAUDE.md template, cheat sheet, first 5 things to try)

### What to keep:
- All MCP servers (proof of expertise + teaching material)
- All agents and skills (showcase + templates for community)
- aeo-protocol-sop.md (case study content + active service offering)
- Video production pipeline (use it to produce YouTube content)
- Client delivery system (active for Fuegenix + template for community)

### What to pause:
- MentionedIn.ai SaaS build (revisit at Month 6 as community project)
- MentionedIn.ai SaaS spec refinement (pause until Month 6 when it becomes the community build-along project)

## 13. RESEARCH DATA (Supporting Evidence)

### Top Skool Communities by Revenue (Feb 2026)

| Community | Founder | Price | Members | Est. MRR | Category |
|-----------|---------|-------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Evolve** | Spencer Pawliw | $1,250/mo | ~1,200 | **~$1.5M** | Ecom (MMO) |
| Maker School | Nick Saraev | $184/mo | ~2,100 | ~$386K | AI Automation (MMO) |
| KubeCraft | Mischa van den Burg | $400/mo ($4,800/yr) | 857 | ~$343K | DevOps career (Pure Skill) |
| AIS Plus | Nate Herk | $99/mo | 3,400 | ~$337K | AI Automation (Hybrid) |
| **Vibe Coding School** | Zac Frulloni | $447/mo | 408 | **~$182K** | Vibe coding (Pure MMO) |
| Get Clients University | Dan Henry | $97/mo | 1,200 | ~$116K | Client acquisition (Hybrid) |
| Vibe Coding Academy | Alex Finn | $97/mo | 469 | ~$45K | AI apps (MMO) |
| AI Founders Academy | Chris Ashby | $59/mo | 254 | ~$15K | Vibe coding (MMO) |
| Vibe Coding is Life | Mark Fulton | $10-99/mo | 531 | ~$5.3-52.6K* | General vibe coding (MMO + Skill) |
| Claude Co-workers | Samin Yasar | $49/mo | 97 | ~$4.8K | Claude Code (Hybrid) |
| Vibe Code Society | James Renouf | $20/mo | 153 | ~$3K | General vibe coding (Pure MMO) |
| SHE IS AI | Josette Williams | $19/mo | ~76-99 | ~$1.5-1.9K | General AI (Skill/Community) |
| Vibe Coding Academy #2 | David Gilmore | $20/mo | 74 | ~$1.5K | General vibe coding (MMO + Skill) |

*\* Mark Fulton's community has tiered pricing ($10-99/mo). Actual average price per member is unknown, so MRR range reflects the full $10-99 spectrum. True MRR is likely in the $10-25K range based on typical tier distribution.*

**Key insight:** KubeCraft at $400/mo with ~$343K MRR and ~92% retention proves that premium pure-skill communities generate serious, sustainable revenue. Evolve at $1,250/mo with ~$1.5M MRR proves ultra-premium Skool pricing works for the right audience.

**Note on Nick Saraev:** Categorized as MMO based on his second community ("Make Money With Make.com," $368/mo), video titles ("How I Made $102,514 Last Month," "5 Automations You Can Sell For $1,500+"), and self-disclosed 20% monthly churn. Revenue is real but positioning requires constant backfill.

**Note on Liam Ottley vs Nate Herk:** These are two different people often confused in this space. Liam Ottley runs "AI Automation Agency Hub" (292K free Skool members, 731K YouTube subscribers) and sells the AAA Accelerator at $5K+ one-time. His focus is the AI agency business model. Nate Herk runs "AI Automation Society" (255K free members) and "AIS Plus" ($99/mo, 3,400 paid members, ~$337K MRR). Nate is a 4x Skool Games winner. His focus is n8n automations. They are not the same person and their communities are separate.

**Note on Zac Frulloni:** Vibe Coding School at $447/mo with 408 members (~$182K MRR) is the #2 vibe coding community by MRR after Nate Herk. Pure MMO positioning at a premium price point. Proves there is willingness to pay $400+/mo for vibe coding education, but the MMO angle means retention is likely a challenge (no public churn data).

**Skool Games winners:**
- Nate Herk's AIS Plus is a 4x Skool Games winner
- Nick Saraev won the Skool Games once with $335K/mo in MRR growth
- Games measure MRR GROWTH (not total MRR), so newer communities can win
- Winning requires rapid member acquisition, which favors MMO and hybrid positioning

### YouTube Landscape (Feb 2026)

| Creator | Subs | Videos | Avg Views | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Alex Finn | ~110K | 196 | 89.5K | Self-proclaimed "#1 vibe coding channel" |
| Peter Yang | 60.7K | - | - | "15-minute build" format confirmed most engaging |

**Content gap analysis (all 6 verified as still open):**
1. Multi-agent orchestration tutorials (MAJOR GAP - nobody teaching this)
2. MCP server setup guides (HIGH - setup complexity is where people quit)
3. Non-developer Claude Code workflows (GROWING - Fortune/Lenny validated demand)
4. Context management at scale (CRITICAL - common Reddit complaint)
5. Hooks & advanced automation (MEDIUM-HIGH)
6. "15-minute build" format (PROVEN - Peter Yang's most engaging format)

**Key keyword insight:** "vibe coding tutorial" is dominated by Cursor/Windsurf content, NOT Claude Code. This is a wide-open opportunity.

### Market Validation

**Claude Code / Anthropic:**
- Claude Code: $1B ARR in 6 months (fastest-growing AI product)
- Anthropic: $9B ARR (2025), projecting $20-26B (2026), $350B valuation
- 4% of all public GitHub commits now authored by Claude Code (SemiAnalysis, Feb 2026)
- SemiAnalysis projects 20%+ of all daily commits by Claude Code by end 2026
- 90-95% of Claude Code itself is written by Claude Code (Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger)
- Microsoft adopted Claude Code internally (despite selling Copilot)
- VS Code Claude Code extension: 29M daily installs
- Boris Cherny (head of Claude Code) told Fortune (Jan 24, 2026): "We just want to make it much easier for non-programmers"

**Market size:**
- AI coding tools market: $7.37B (2025)
- AI code generation market: $4.91B (2024), projected $30.1B by 2032
- Gartner: 60% of new software code will be AI-generated by 2026
- Vibe coding startup valuations grew 350% YoY to $36B
- Online education market: $320-400B globally (2026)
- Skool platform: 170,000 total communities (large addressable market for community-based education)

**Cultural signals:**
- Collins Dictionary named "vibe coding" 2025 Word of the Year
- Karpathy coined "agentic engineering" as successor to vibe coding (Feb 2026)
- "Vibe coding" post: 4.5M views (cultural moment)
- **63% of vibe coding users identify as non-developers** - this is the core market
- Lenny Rachitsky: "Everyone should be using Claude Code more" (Oct 14, 2025). 500+ people shared Claude Code stories with him. The post generated 363,700 X views, 2,100 retweets, 3,700 likes, and 579 Substack comments.

### Free Course Competitive Landscape

These free/low-cost courses create DEMAND for Claude Code education (good for us) but set the floor for what "free" gets you:

| Provider | Course | Audience | Limitation |
|----------|--------|----------|------------|
| Anthropic | "Claude Code in Action" (21 lessons, Skilljar/Coursera) | Developers | Developer-focused, no business context |
| DeepLearning.AI + Andrew Ng | CC fundamentals | Technical | Requires Python/Git knowledge |
| Carl Vellotti | "CC for Everyone" + "CC for PMs" (Maven) | Non-devs, PMs | Innovative (learn CC inside CC), 2,000+ PMs completed, 7,394 total students. No ongoing community. |
| Coursera (Vanderbilt) | Vanderbilt CC course | Developers | Academic, developer-oriented |
| Scrimba | "Vibe Coding Essentials" | Beginners | Broad (not Claude Code-specific) |
| LinkedIn Learning | "Claude Code for Non-Programmers" | Non-devs | Self-paced, no community |

**Key takeaway:** Free courses teach WHAT Claude Code can do. They do not teach how to apply it to YOUR specific business. That is the paid community's value proposition: "Anthropic teaches you what Claude Code can do. We teach you how to make it work for YOUR specific business."

### Pricing Data
- Skool average churn: 18% (confirmed)
- Premium communities: $97-400/mo
- High-commitment: $4,800/yr (KubeCraft model - evolved from $47/mo -> $99/mo -> $4,800/yr)
- Ultra-premium: $1,250/mo (Evolve model)
- Recommended for this plan: $97/mo (established credibility tier, can increase later)
- Annual option: $970/yr (~17% discount) to lock in retention
- Future VIP tier: $297/mo, limited to 20 seats (Month 6+)
- LTV at $97/mo with 10% churn: $970. At 5% churn (with annual pricing): $1,940.
