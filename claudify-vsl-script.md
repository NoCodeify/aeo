## HOOK (0:00-0:40)

| Visual | What You Say |
|--------|------------|
| LAYOUT: gradual_zoom | |
| Speaker | "So you've seen what Claude Code can do. You've watched the demos. You've seen people build entire apps in 10 minutes. And maybe you've opened a terminal and tried it yourself." |
| Speaker | "And then you hit the wall." |
| GIF: hitting a wall | |
| Speaker | "You built something cool. Maybe a chatbot or a small tool. But then you thought, okay, now what? How do I go from this little demo to something that actually runs my business? Something my clients use? Something that makes me money?" |
| Speaker | "That gap between 'that was cool' and 'this is real' is where everyone gets stuck. And that's exactly what I'm going to solve today." |

---

## SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM (0:40-2:50)

| Visual | What You Say |
|--------|------------|
| SFX: whoosh | |
| LAYOUT: speaker_full | |
| Speaker | "Well, here's what happens. You find a tutorial. It shows you how to build a chatbot, or how to set up an MCP server, or how to do some cool thing with agents. You follow along. It works. Great." |
| Speaker | "And then you close the video and think, okay, but how does this help me? How do I actually use this for my business? How do I build something that handles real edge cases, that works when I'm not watching it, that my clients or customers actually depend on?" |
| GIF: confused thinking | |
| Speaker | "So you try to figure it out on your own. You Google around, you ask ChatGPT, you join some Discord. You piece together bits from five different tutorials. And you spend a week building something that kind of works but breaks in ways you don't understand." |
| Speaker | "So you go back to YouTube. You keep watching. You keep saving bookmarks. You keep telling yourself you'll figure it out eventually. But you're just going in circles." |
| BROLL: person scrolling phone | |
| Speaker | "And meanwhile, you're still paying for SaaS tools that do 80% of what you need. That one feature you actually need? 'It's on our roadmap.' Yeah, it's been on the roadmap for two years. You're still outsourcing work you could handle yourself if you just had the right system. You're still sitting on ideas because you assumed you'd need a developer or a co-founder to make them real." |
| SLIDE 01: Cost of waiting - SaaS subscriptions, outsourcing, ideas stuck | |
| Speaker | "And that time adds up. Every month you wait is another month of paying for software that almost works. Another month of potential revenue just sitting on the table. Another month where someone else ships the thing you've been thinking about." |
| TEXT: "Every month you wait..." | |
| Speaker | "The problem isn't that you can't do it. The problem is that nobody has shown you the complete picture. From first build to production system. In a way that actually applies to what you do. Not a demo. Not a toy project. A real system for a real business." |

---

## SECTION 2: THE PROOF (2:50-5:45)

| Visual | What You Say |
|--------|------------|
| SFX: whoosh | |
| LAYOUT: gradual_zoom | |
| Speaker | "So let me show you that complete picture. Because I've already built it." |
| SLIDE 02: 5 production systems - DMChamp, CI/CD, Consulting, NFC, Video | |
| Speaker | "I built DMChamp. It's an AI sales agent. You connect it to your WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, or your website, and it has real conversations with your customers. It handles objections, answers product questions, remembers past interactions, and actually closes deals. Not a chatbot that says 'let me transfer you to an agent.' An actual AI that sells." |
| TEXT: "$100K/yr SaaS" | |
| Speaker | "DMChamp makes about a hundred thousand dollars a year. Real customers paying every month. Clinics, restaurants, online stores, service businesses. Worldwide. Not a demo. Not a side project." |
| LAYOUT: speaker_full | |
| Speaker | "I built an agentic CI/CD pipeline. And I know that sounds technical, so let me put it simply. When a bug comes in at 3 AM, an AI agent reads the ticket, investigates the code, figures out what's wrong, writes the fix, tests it, and sends the customer a WhatsApp message saying 'hey, we found the issue, it's resolved.' By the time I wake up, it's done. I didn't touch anything. I just review the fix and approve it. That's my entire role in the development process now." |
| SLIDE 03: CI/CD flow - Bug detected -> Investigated -> Fixed -> Customer notified | |
| Speaker | "I built a full consulting delivery system. Custom AI agents, MCP servers, automated workflows, the whole pipeline for delivering client work. One client pays two grand a month for a service that runs on this system." |
| Speaker | "I built an NFC smart lock system. And I know that sounds random, but hear me out. This is hardware. Firmware. The phone charges the lock via NFC, authenticates you, and unlocks the door. Not software. Not an app. Physical hardware that controls access to a building. Built with Claude Code." |
| GIF: mind blown | |
| Speaker | "And I built a video production pipeline, a cold outreach system that researches every company before it writes a single word, and a marketing automation stack." |
| Speaker | "All of this with Claude Code. No agency. No dev team. No co-founder." |
| SLIDE 04: "No agency. No dev team. No co-founder." | |
| Speaker | "Now, I didn't start yesterday. I've been building online since I was a teenager. Made my first money at 14 from YouTube. By 16 I was making thousands per day from content. I co-founded an agency, grew it to six figures with a team of 10, sold my share. I was CMO at a company called FueGenix where I helped scale from zero to 10 million. I ran a marketing agency working with clinics from Miami to Dubai." |
| BROLL: dubai skyline | |
| Speaker | "But the point is not my background. The point is this: every single thing I'm teaching inside Claudify, I built and I run. Right now. This is not theory. These are production systems." |

## SECTION 3: WHAT IS CLAUDIFY (5:45-7:00)

| Visual | What You Say |
|--------|------------|
| SFX: whoosh | |
| LAYOUT: speaker_full | |
| Speaker | "So what is Claudify? It's the community I wish existed when I started building with Claude Code." |
| Speaker | "When I was figuring all of this out, there was nothing. No structured path. No one to ask. No templates to start from. Just me and Claude Code in a terminal, figuring it out the hard way. Every mistake, every dead end, every 'why isn't this working' moment. I had to solve it all myself." |
| Speaker | "So I built the thing I wish I had. A structured system with live support, a community of builders, and templates pulled directly from the production systems I just showed you." |
| SLIDE 05: Three tracks - Build for yourself / Build a product / Build a service | |
| Speaker | "There are three tracks. You pick the one that fits your situation." |
| Speaker | "Track A: build for yourself. Replace SaaS tools you're paying for. Automate your workflows. Create internal systems that fit exactly how your business works. Stop paying for software that almost does what you need." |
| Speaker | "Track B: build a product. Follow the same path I used to ship a hundred-K SaaS. From idea to paying customers." |
| Speaker | "Track C: build a service. Learn how to package and sell Claude Code implementation work to clients at 2 to 5K per project. There's real demand for this and almost nobody knows how to deliver it yet." |
| Speaker | "Everything inside comes from real systems. Not demo apps. Not throwaway tutorials. The CLAUDE.md files, the agent configs, the project structures. They're all pulled from businesses that are running right now." |

## SECTION 4: WHAT YOU GET (7:00-8:50)

| Visual | What You Say |
|--------|------------|
| SFX: whoosh | |
| LAYOUT: speaker_full | |
| Speaker | "So here's what's actually inside." |
| SLIDE 06: 21-Day Quick Start - day-by-day path with milestones | |
| Speaker | "The 21-Day Quick Start. This is not 'here's six videos, good luck.' It's a day-by-day path. Day 1 you install Claude Code. Day 2 you pick a real task from your actual work and do it. Day 4 you're writing a CLAUDE.md for your own project. Day 7 you start building your first real system. Not a tutorial project. Something for your business." |
| TEXT: "Day 1 to Day 21" | |
| Speaker | "And I personally check in at Day 7 and Day 14 to make sure you're not stuck. By Day 21, you have a working system. That's the milestone." |
| Speaker | "Foundations. 20-plus modules covering everything from custom commands and skills to building agents, MCP servers, multi-agent teams, and advanced patterns. New modules drop every month so it stays current. Claude Code moves fast. This keeps up." |
| SLIDE 07: Foundations module grid - Commands, Agents, MCP, Teams, Hooks, etc. | |
| Speaker | "Case Studies. Five full breakdowns from systems I built and run in production. DMChamp. The CI/CD pipeline. The consulting delivery system. The NFC smart lock. The content and outreach stack. These are not walkthroughs of toy projects. You're looking at the actual architecture of real businesses and understanding why every decision was made." |
| Speaker | "The Build Lab. This is the weekly live call, every Thursday. Some weeks it's hot seats. You share your screen, we build together in real time. Some weeks I take someone's CLAUDE.md and tear it apart live. Brutally honest, immediately useful. Other weeks a member demos what they built and I go through the architecture and tell them what to fix and where to go next." |
| SLIDE 08: The Build Lab - Hot seats, CLAUDE.md Roasts, Project Teardowns | |
| Speaker | "Service Track. A complete playbook for selling Claude Code implementation services. How to scope a project. How to price it. How to deliver. How to find clients. For anyone who wants to turn this skill into a business." |
| Speaker | "And for annual members: The Vault. Production-grade templates pulled from real businesses. CLAUDE.md files, agent configs, project starters. These are the shortcuts. Instead of building everything from scratch, you copy what works and adapt it. That alone saves you weeks. Annual members also get a 1-on-1 project review with me, priority access on Build Lab calls, and two months free." |
| SLIDE 09: Annual perks - The Vault + 1-on-1 + Priority + 2 months free | |

## SECTION 5: OBJECTION HANDLING (8:50-9:15)

| Visual | What You Say |
|--------|------------|
| LAYOUT: speaker_full | |
| Speaker | "Now, I know what you might be thinking. So let me just get the three big ones out of the way." |
| TEXT: "What if I'm not technical?" | |
| Speaker | "'What if I'm not technical?' The Quick Start assumes zero Claude Code experience. Day 1 is literally 'install Claude Code.' You don't need a CS degree. You don't need to know how to code. And when you hit a wall, you post in Help and Debug and someone, usually me, gets you unstuck. That's the whole point of doing this in a community instead of figuring it out alone." |
| TEXT: "What if I don't have time?" | |
| Speaker | "'What if I don't have time?' 30 to 60 minutes per day. That's it. Each day in the Quick Start has one action and one community touchpoint. You can do more, but you don't need to. This is designed for people who have a business to run. Not people who can sit at a computer for 8 hours a day." |
| TEXT: "What if it doesn't work for my business?" | |
| Speaker | "'What if it doesn't work for my business?' The three tracks cover internal tools, products, and services. If you run a business, one of these tracks applies to what you do. And if you're not sure which one, bring your specific use case to The Build Lab and we'll figure it out live. That's what the call is for." |

## CLOSE + CTA (9:15-9:55)

| Visual | What You Say |
|--------|------------|
| SFX: shimmer | |
| LAYOUT: gradual_zoom | |
| Speaker | "Claudify is 97 dollars a month. There's also an annual plan at 970 a year which gets you The Vault, a 1-on-1 project review, priority access on Build Lab calls, and two months free." |
| TEXT: "$97/mo" | |
| Speaker | "The price you lock in today is yours for life. We're going to increase the price as the community grows and the content library gets deeper. If you join now, you keep your rate forever. Early members always win." |
| SLIDE 10: "Lock in $97/mo for life" | |
| Speaker | "The 21-Day Quick Start gives you a clear path. Follow the modules. Show up to The Build Lab. Post your work. Do the daily actions. By Day 21, you'll have a working Claude Code system built for your actual business. Not a demo. Something real." |
| Speaker | "You've spent enough time watching what Claude Code can do. You've saved enough bookmarks. You've watched enough tutorials. It's time to actually build something." |
| SFX: boop | |
| Speaker | "I'll see you inside." |
| TEXT: CTA overlay | |

## Script Notes (internal)

**Tone checks:**
- No "no coding required" (defensive framing) - uses "assumes zero Claude Code experience"
- No specific agent/skill counts (confusing) - uses plain descriptions
- No "fully automated" - uses "largely automated" / "I just do quality checks"
- No income promises for members
- No em dashes
- Lead with what was built, not founder's background
- Conversational voice: "So", "Well", run-on thoughts, casual vocab

**Structure follows KubeCraft model:**
- Problem: the tutorial-to-production gap
- Proof: founder's portfolio (system credibility, not income screenshots)
- What is Claudify: structured system, not a course
- What you get: concrete deliverables with specifics
- Objection handling: three common objections addressed directly
- CTA: price, price lock, 21-day path, closing line

**Competitor patterns applied:**
- Cost of waiting (KubeCraft): "Every month you wait..."
- Price lock (Nate Herk): "The price you lock in today is yours for life"
- Objection handling (KubeCraft): three direct answers
- "I'll see you inside" close (Nate Herk, KubeCraft)
- No testimonial montage needed (KubeCraft): works on system credibility
- Rotating Build Lab formats (Nick Saraev roasts)

**Founder story sources:**
- DMChamp, CI/CD, NFC, consulting system: `new-plan-wip-draft.md`
- Background (YouTube, agency, FueGenix, SMB360): `youtube/stories/Achievements.md`
- Background kept to one paragraph. The builds are the story, not the resume
