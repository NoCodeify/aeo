# YouTube Video Ideation (Ed Lawrence Method + Tournament Selection)

Generate video concepts (title + thumbnail + angle) that pass Ed Lawrence's critical filters, then use tournament selection to identify the strongest idea.

## Core Workflow

The ideation process follows these steps:

1. **Goal Setting** - Define video objective (email/sales/views)
2. **Positioning Check** - Verify alignment with channel positioning
3. **Concept Generation** - Create 10 video concepts using Ed's patterns
4. **Tournament Selection** - Narrow through systematic comparison (10 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1)
5. **Final Validation** - Verify passes Ed's 3 critical questions

---

## Step 1: Goal Setting

Before generating ideas, clarify the video's purpose:

**Three Goals:**
1. **Email Signups** - Optimize for clicks to lead magnet
2. **Sales** - Target dream buyer's specific problem
3. **Views** - Jump on trends, broader appeal

Ask: "What is this video supposed to achieve?"

Document the goal before proceeding.

---

## Step 2: Positioning Check

**AEO Channel Positioning:**

**Avatar:** Business owners and marketers who've invested in SEO/digital marketing but are invisible to ChatGPT/Gemini. They're solution-aware (know AI search matters) but don't know how to fix it.

**Backstory:**
- Scaled hair clinic $0 -> $5M with Meta ads (3 years)
- Scaled same clinic $5M -> $10M with AI chatbots
- ChatGPT convinced ME to buy a Porsche instead of BMW
- Now pioneering AEO optimization

**Enemy:** Traditional SEO agencies that ignore AI search. Brands that think "if it's not on Google, it doesn't exist."

**Belief:** "SEO is dying. The brands that win in 2026+ will be the ones ChatGPT recommends."

**Space:** THE AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) expert showing real results from ChatGPT/Gemini visibility.

---

## Step 3: The Three Critical Questions (Filter)

Every video idea MUST pass these before tournament:

### Question 1: Do my viewers even know what this means?
- Avoid jargon or concepts your avatar doesn't recognize
- If they don't understand the words, they won't click
- "AEO" needs context - pair with "ChatGPT" or "AI search"

### Question 2: Do they understand why it matters?
- The value must be immediately obvious
- Don't make them guess why they should care
- Connect to business outcomes (revenue, leads, visibility)

### Question 3: Do they think it solves the problem they actually have?
- Match their perceived problem, not the "real" problem
- Speak to what keeps them up at night
- "Invisible to AI" resonates more than "lack structured data"

**Pre-filter rule:** If an idea fails any question, discard it before tournament.

## Step 3b: Title & Thumbnail Kill List (MANDATORY)

**NEVER generate titles that match these anti-patterns. Reject immediately.**

### Title Kill List

| Anti-Pattern | Example (BAD) | Fix |
|--------------|----------------|-----|
| Process-focused | "The 5-Step System I Use" | Lead with THEIR problem, not your method |
| YOUR perspective | "...I Use With Every Client" | Make it about THEM failing/missing out |
| Jargon alone | "AEO Audit System" | Pair jargon with plain language ("ChatGPT") |
| No specificity | "How to Optimize for AI" | Add number, timeframe, or percentage |
| No emotional trigger | "My Complete Audit Framework" | Add fear, curiosity, or urgency |
| Describes content | "5-Step Audit Walkthrough" | Sell the OUTCOME not the format |
| Missing positioning keyword | "The System That Changed Everything" | Must include ChatGPT/Gemini/AI |
| Generic how-to | "How I Audit Brands for Visibility" | Create curiosity gap instead |

### Thumbnail Kill List

| Anti-Pattern | Example (BAD) | Fix |
|--------------|----------------|-----|
| Descriptive text | "5-STEP AUDIT" | Use emotional text ("YOU FAILED", "INVISIBLE") |
| Repeats title | Title has "5 Steps", thumb says "5 STEPS" | Thumbnail adds NEW information |
| Too many words | "AEO AUDIT SYSTEM" | 3 words max, emotional ones |
| No face/emotion | Just text on background | Face with clear shock/concern/excitement |
| No visual metaphor | Plain text on solid color | Add something to decode (red X, ghost, etc.) |
| Boring colors | Low contrast, muted | High contrast, readable in any feed |

### The Two Tests (Apply to EVERY concept)

1. **Scroll test:** Would a busy business owner stop scrolling for this title?
2. **Mute test:** Would the thumbnail alone (no title visible) create curiosity?

If either test fails, reject the concept.

---

## Step 4: Concept Generation

Generate 10 video concepts using these patterns:

### Pattern Distribution:
- **3 Pain Point concepts** - Lead with viewer's problem
- **3 Proof concepts** - Lead with your results/credibility
- **2 Comparison concepts** - Test/compare approaches
- **2 Contrarian concepts** - Challenge conventional wisdom

### For Each Concept, Define:

**TITLE:** The exact video title
**THUMBNAIL:** Visual description (face + text + metaphor)
**ANGLE:** What makes THIS video different from others
**HOOK:** The first 10 seconds (pattern interrupt)

### Title Formulas:

**CRITICAL POSITIONING RULE:**
**ALWAYS include positioning keywords: AEO, ChatGPT, Gemini, AI search, LLM**

Examples:
- Include "ChatGPT" or "Gemini" in every title
- Use "AEO" when audience is aware of term
- Add business context ("Your Brand", "Your Business")

## Ed Lawrence Title Performance Data (Real Results)

**Source:** Ed Lawrence's channel, past 12 months. Multiplier = views vs channel average.

### Top Performers (3x+ multiplier)

| Title | Views | Mult | Pattern |
|-------|-------|------|---------|
| "Copy This Video Style, It'll Blow Up Your Business" | 508K | 26x | Copy This + Promise |
| "The EXACT System To Go From $0-$1,000,000 On YouTube" | 160K | 8.2x | EXACT System + Money |
| "Copy This YouTube Strategy, It'll Blow Up Your Business" | 131K | 6.7x | Copy This + Promise |
| "Copy This YouTube Video, It'll Blow Up Your Business" | 112K | 5.7x | Copy This + Promise |
| "5 NEW AI That Just Changed YouTube Forever" | 91K | 4.6x | News/Trend |
| "EXACTLY How To Create A $1,000,000 YouTube Strategy" | 66K | 3.4x | EXACTLY + Money |
| "YouTube's Hard, Until Businesses Do This" | 61K | 3.1x | Hard Until |
| "The EXACT System To Turn Viewers In To Buyers" | 59K | 3x | EXACT System + Outcome |
| "I Studied 1,000 YouTubers, This Stops Them Making Money" | 58K | 3x | Research + Negative |

| "The EXACT Storytelling System That Turns Viewers In To Buyers" | 52K | 2.7x | EXACT System + Outcome |

### Underperformers (below 1x multiplier)

| Title | Views | Mult | Why It Failed |
|-------|-------|------|---------------|
| "EXACTLY How to make sales from EVERY video you make" | 10K | 0.5x | Generic promise, no specificity |
| "Make Videos Like This in 2026, It'll Blow Up Your Business" | 11K | 0.6x | Year reference weakens |
| "How To Make A YouTube Video (That Blows Up Your Business)" | 19K | 1x | Generic "How To" |
| "19 Lessons Learned Working With 700 YouTubers" | 15K | 0.8x | Listicle format |
| "27 Business Lessons I Wish I Knew Sooner" | 15K | 0.8x | Listicle format |
| "Give Me 5 mins & I'll Stop Your Business Failing On YouTube" | 8.1K | 0.4x | Time promise feels gimmicky |

### Proven Title Formulas (Ranked by Performance)

**Tier 1: Highest performers**
1. **"Copy This [X], It'll Blow Up Your Business"** - 4 of top 10 videos use this
2. **"The EXACT System To [specific $ outcome]"** - Needs specific money amount
3. **"I Studied [large number], [negative finding]"** - Research + pain

**Tier 2: Strong performers**
4. **"EXACTLY How To [outcome with $ amount]"** - Must include money
5. **"[X]'s Hard, Until [solution]"** - Tension then relief
6. **"I [contrarian action] & [positive result]"** - Quit/stopped + grew

**Tier 3: Moderate performers**
7. **"[Number] [Things] That [Changed/Wrecked] [Outcome]"** - Needs emotional verb
8. **Negative hooks** - "DESTROYS", "Wrecks", "Stops" outperform positive

**Avoid:**
- Generic "How To Make..." (performs at 1x or below)
- Listicles without emotional hook (15K average)
- Year references in titles (weakens performance)
- Vague outcomes without specific numbers
- Time promises ("Give me 5 mins")

### Key Insights

1. **"Copy This" > "How To"** - Command beats educate
2. **Specific $ amounts are mandatory** - "$1,000,000" beats "make money"
3. **Negative hooks outperform positive** - "DESTROYS" > "Improves"
4. **Research-backed adds credibility** - "I Studied 1,000" works
5. **Time-bound results work** - "In 30 Days", "In 7 Days"
