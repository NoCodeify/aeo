# Excalidraw-Style Slides

Generate detailed Imagen prompts for hand-drawn whiteboard-style slides that support talking head YouTube videos.

## The Style: Excalidraw Whiteboard

Think: Alex Hormozi whiteboard videos, startup founder explaining on a whiteboard, quick sketch during a meeting.

**This IS:**
- Hand-drawn, wobbly lines
- Imperfect shapes
- Handwritten text
- Simple icons and stick figures
- PURE WHITE background (critical for consistency)
- One accent color (orange-red)
- Casual, authentic, human
- "Let me sketch this out for you" energy

**This is NOT:**
- Corporate PowerPoint
- Polished infographics
- Stock illustrations
- Technical blueprints
- Pixel art or retro aesthetics
- Gradient-heavy modern design

---

## Visual Specifications

### Background (CRITICAL)
- **PURE WHITE background. Solid #FFFFFF.**
- NOT cream, NOT off-white, NOT gray, NOT #FAFAFA
- Absolutely pure white like blank printer paper
- NO gradients, NO textures, NO grids, NO variation
- This ensures consistency across all slides

### Line Quality
All strokes should appear hand-drawn:
- Slightly wobbly (not perfectly straight)
- Varying pressure (subtle thickness variation)
- Endpoints don't quite connect perfectly
- "Drawn with a marker" feel
- Stroke weight: Medium (2-3px equivalent)

### Colors
| Element | Color | Hex |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Background | **PURE WHITE** | #FFFFFF |
| Primary strokes | Dark charcoal | #1e1e1e |
| Secondary/ghosted | Medium gray | #999999 |
| Accent (emphasis) | Orange-red | #E07A5F |

**Rules:**
- Background MUST be pure white #FFFFFF - never cream, off-white, or gray
- Use accent color sparingly - one or two moments per slide maximum

### Typography
All text should appear hand-written:
- Imperfect letter forms
- Slightly uneven baseline
- Varying letter sizes within words
- NOT a "handwriting font" - actual sketch quality
- Like someone wrote it quickly with a marker

### Common Elements

**Numbers/Stats:**
- Large, bold, hand-drawn numerals
- Slightly tilted or uneven
- Optional circle or underline for emphasis

**Icons:**
- Simple building = rectangle + triangle roof
- Person = stick figure or simple head/shoulders
- Money = $ sign or simple stack sketch
- Growth = upward arrow, wobbly line graph
- Comparison = two circles or boxes with "vs"

**Annotations:**
- Hand-drawn arrows pointing to elements
- Small handwritten notes
- Question marks, exclamation points
- Circled items for emphasis

## Workflow

1. **Read the script/brief** - Identify visual beats
2. **List the slides needed** - One concept per slide
3. **Determine slide type** - Stat, comparison, framework, etc.
4. **Write detailed prompt** - Follow the structure above
5. **Generate with Imagen** - Use `mcp__imagen__generate_images`
6. **Review and iterate** - Adjust prompts if needed

---

## Remember

1. **Hand-drawn everything** - No perfect shapes, no straight lines
2. **White background** - Clean, empty, whiteboard feel
3. **One accent color** - Orange-red, used sparingly
4. **Simple icons** - Just enough to be recognizable
5. **Handwritten text** - Imperfect, human, quick
6. **Prompts must be detailed** - 500-1500 words each
7. **Hormozi energy** - Founder on a whiteboard, not corporate presentation
