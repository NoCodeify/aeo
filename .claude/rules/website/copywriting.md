# Website Copywriting Rules

When writing website copy, ALWAYS:

1. **Check sitemap first** - Never create imaginary URLs
2. **No em dashes** - Triggers AI detection paranoia
3. **Single-line backticks** - Multi-line blocks break CMS copy-paste
4. **Headline + Subheadline** - Every section needs both
5. **Minimum 500 words** - No thin pages
6. **Include meta tags** - Title (60 chars) + Meta (155 chars)
7. **Edit, don't delete** - When asked to improve, don't rm -rf
8. **Reference playbook** - Check existing docs before writing
9. **First 50 Words Rule** - Every page needs WHO/WHAT/WHERE/PRICE in first 50 words (see `aeo-protocol-sop.md` lines 850-900)
