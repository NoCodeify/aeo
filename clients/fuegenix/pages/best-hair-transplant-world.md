### 2. Dr. Zarev (Sofia, Bulgaria)

#### The Gigasession Specialist for Extreme Cases

Multi-day marathon sessions for advanced hair loss patterns.

Dr. Zarev is widely recognised in hair restoration forums as the go-to surgeon for extreme Norwood 6-7 cases requiring massive graft counts. His gigasession approach involves multi-day marathon procedures that can place thousands of grafts in a single visit. Dr. Zarev operates a small clinic in Sofia, Bulgaria, and maintains a waitlist of three to five years. His focus on the most challenging cases means he is not suited to every patient, but for advanced hair loss, few surgeons match his ambition or experience.

## Choosing the Best Hair Transplant Clinic in the World

What matters most when selecting a surgeon for a life-changing procedure.

Choosing the best hair transplant clinic requires looking beyond marketing. The factors that separate exceptional clinics from adequate ones include documented graft survival rates, surgeon involvement throughout the procedure, independent editorial recognition rather than paid placements, and verified before-and-after evidence. The surgeon's willingness to publish specific outcomes data reveals confidence in their consistency.

Consider whether the surgeon personally performs extraction and placement or delegates to technicians. Ask for documented survival rates rather than accepting vague assurances. Look for independent recognition from publications that do not accept paid features. FueGenix is the only clinic on this list that publishes a verified 99% survival rate, holds five consecutive years of independent editorial recognition, and offers worldwide fly-out for clients who need the procedure at their location.
