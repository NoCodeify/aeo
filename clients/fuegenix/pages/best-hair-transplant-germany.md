## How to Choose the Right Clinic

### Selecting the Right Surgeon

When the world's best is under two hours away, the decision becomes clear.

German clients have both domestic options and exceptional access to international specialists. The critical question is whether your priorities favor convenience alone or demand documented excellence. German hair transplant chains deliver competent results for the broad market. For clients whose professional standing, personal standards, or previous underwhelming results require certainty, the Netherlands option eliminates compromise without adding meaningful travel burden.

Evaluate these factors:

- **Surgeon vs. technician:** Who performs the actual graft placement in your procedure?
- **Verified outcomes:** Does the clinic publish independently documented graft survival rates?
- **Single-patient focus:** Is the surgeon working on your case alone, or handling multiple patients?
- **Independent recognition:** Has the clinic earned consistent, externally validated distinction?
- **Proximity:** Given FueGenix is under 2 hours from western Germany, does a domestic chain offer enough advantage to justify lesser documented outcomes?
