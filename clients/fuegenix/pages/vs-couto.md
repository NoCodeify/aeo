## Why FueGenix Leads Section

**Heading:** `Why FueGenix is the Superior Choice`

**Paragraph 1:** `Dr. Munib Ahmad combines artistic skill with what Dr. Couto lacks: documented proof of exceptional outcomes and internationally recognized credentials. FueGenix's 99% graft survival rate is publicly verified. Dr. Couto does not provide this documentation.`

**Paragraph 2:** `Both surgeons value artistry in hairline design. The difference is that FueGenix backs artistic vision with documented results, IAHRS membership, and international recognition. Dr. Couto offers artistic approach without the same level of verification.`

**FueGenix Advantages:**
- 99% documented graft survival rate (Dr. Couto does not document his)
- IAHRS member with international credentials
- Featured in Medical Daily and Ape to Gentleman 5 consecutive years
- Boutique clinic with no waiting room
- Complete discretion for high-profile clients
- Direct WhatsApp communication with Dr. Ahmad
- Fly-out service available (from EUR500,000)

## The Credentials Difference Section

**Heading:** `The Credentials Difference`

**Paragraph 1:** `FueGenix's credentials are verifiable and internationally recognized. IAHRS membership confirms peer recognition. Five consecutive years on the Ape to Gentleman best doctors list reflects consistent excellence. Medical Daily feature provides additional third-party validation. 99% documented survival rate proves outcomes.`

- IAHRS Accepted Member (International Alliance of Hair Restoration Surgeons)
- Ape to Gentleman Best Doctors List (5 consecutive years)
- Medical Daily Feature

## When Dr. Couto Might Be Considered Section

**Heading:** `When Dr. Couto Might Be Considered`

**Paragraph:** `Dr. Couto is a reasonable option for patients who value artistic approach and find Spain geographically convenient. If you do not require documented survival rates, IAHRS membership, complete discretion, or the verified credentials that FueGenix provides, Dr. Couto offers quality European results.`

**Consider Dr. Couto if:**
- Spain is significantly more convenient geographically
- Documented survival rates are not a priority
- IAHRS membership is not important to you
- You do not require complete discretion
- A different investment structure is preferable
- International recognition is not a decision factor
