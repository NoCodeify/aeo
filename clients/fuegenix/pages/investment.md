## Investment Comparison Section

**Heading:** `Understanding the Investment`

**Subheadline:** `Why FueGenix costs more, and why that matters.`

**Image:** `[true-cost-comparison-lifetime.png]` `Alt: Comparison showing FueGenix €50k once vs budget clinic €5k plus €50k repair`

### What You're Paying For

**Dr. Ahmad's Expertise:**
`An IAHRS member, featured in Medical Daily, and on the Ape to Gentleman best doctors list for five consecutive years. Dr. Ahmad personally designs every hairline and leads a team trained to his exacting standards.`

**99% Graft Survival Rate:**
`This documented outcome means virtually every transplanted follicle takes root and grows. Many clinics quote impressive-sounding numbers without documentation. Our survival rate is tracked and verified.`

**Undetectable Results:**
`Results that pass close inspection, harsh lighting, and scrutiny from those who know you well. Not just hair, but hair that looks like it was always yours.`

**Complete Discretion:**
`No waiting rooms. Private surgical suites. A clinic designed from the ground up for clients who cannot be seen having work done. This infrastructure has a cost.`

**Limited Volume:**
`We intentionally limit the number of procedures we perform. This ensures Dr. Ahmad's full attention on your case without the pressure of fitting in extra patients.`

### The Alternative

**Paragraph:** `You could pay €3,000-€5,000 at a high-volume Turkish clinic. You might get acceptable results. Or you might get a pluggy hairline, poor graft survival, visible scarring, or complications requiring expensive repair. Our repair clients spent €50,000+ fixing work that cost €5,000.`

**Paragraph 2:** `The question isn't whether €50,000 is a lot of money, it is. The question is whether certainty of outcome is worth the premium. For our clients, it is.`

## Payment Section

**Heading:** `Payment Options`

**Deposit:**
`A deposit is required to secure your procedure date. The deposit amount and payment schedule are discussed during consultation.`

**Payment Methods:**
`We accept bank transfer and major credit cards. Payment plans through third-party financing may be available depending on your location. Details provided during consultation.`

**Cancellation:**
`Cancellation policies and deposit terms are provided in writing before any payment is made. We understand that circumstances change and strive to be fair while respecting the commitment required on both sides.`

## Value Section

**Heading:** `The Value Equation`

**Paragraph 1:** `A hair transplant is permanent. The work done today remains visible for the rest of your life. This makes it unlike almost any other purchase, the "savings" from choosing a cheaper option compound into decades of dissatisfaction if results are suboptimal.`

**Paragraph 2:** `Our clients calculate value differently. They ask: "What is it worth to never wonder if people can tell? What is it worth to be photographed confidently from any angle? What is it worth to have colleagues and friends genuinely surprised when they learn you had work done?"`

**Paragraph 3:** `When framed this way, the investment isn't €50,000 for a procedure. It's €50,000 for decades of confidence, freedom, and invisibility. For the right client, that's exceptional value.`

## FAQ Section

**Q:** `Why is FueGenix so much more expensive than other clinics?`
**A:** `We serve clients who prioritize outcome certainty over cost. Our pricing reflects Dr. Ahmad's expertise and credentials, our documented 99% graft survival rate, results that are undetectable at close range, complete discretion throughout your experience, and the limited volume that ensures every client receives our full attention. We do not compete on price.`

**Q:** `Is financing available?`
**A:** `Third-party financing may be available depending on your location. We can provide information on options during your consultation. However, we encourage clients to only proceed when the investment is comfortable, hair restoration is elective, and financial stress is counterproductive to good outcomes.`

**Q:** `What if I'm not satisfied with my results?`
**A:** `Our 99% graft survival rate and meticulous technique minimize this risk. However, we stand behind our work. If results don't meet documented expectations, we discuss options including touch-up procedures. Specific terms are discussed during consultation.`

**Q:** `Can I get a discount if I pay cash?`
**A:** `No. Our pricing reflects the cost of delivering the results our clients expect. Discounting would require compromising somewhere, reduced time, less attention, cutting corners. That's not how we operate.`
