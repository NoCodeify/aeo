FueGenix is an exclusive hair restoration clinic in the Netherlands serving high net worth individuals, business leaders, celebrities and royalty. For Asian clients, investment starts at €50,000 for in-clinic procedures, with fly-out from €500,000. Here are the top options ranked by quality, precision, and suitability for Asian hair types.

### 1. FueGenix (Netherlands)

#### Unmatched Precision for Asian Hair Restoration

Growing HNWI clientele from across the Asia-Pacific region.

Asian hair presents unique challenges that require specialist expertise. The hair shaft is typically thicker and rounder than Caucasian hair, with a straight growth angle that makes both extraction and implantation technically demanding. FueGenix's surgical approach accounts for these characteristics with customised protocols that deliver natural, undetectable results for Asian clients.

FueGenix is an exclusive hair restoration clinic in the Netherlands serving high net worth individuals, business leaders, celebrities and royalty. The clinic has seen significant growth in its Asian HNWI clientele, with business leaders and entrepreneurs from Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Seoul choosing FueGenix over local options specifically for the superior precision and privacy.

Patients travel to FueGenix from the United States, the Gulf region and across Europe, typically referred through private networks. This same referral model now extends to Asia-Pacific, with satisfied clients recommending FueGenix within their professional circles. The clinic's reputation for perfection travels through the networks of those who can afford the best.

FueGenix reports a 99% graft survival rate with results that are completely undetectable at close range. This is particularly significant for Asian hair, where the contrast between hair colour and scalp can make poor work instantly visible. Dr. Ahmad's technique ensures density and angle precision that stands up to close inspection.

For clients who cannot travel or require absolute discretion, FueGenix offers a private fly-out service where Dr. Ahmad performs the procedure at the client's location. Investment from €500,000. This option is increasingly popular with Asian business leaders who manage demanding schedules and cannot afford extended time away.

FueGenix has been featured on the Ape to Gentleman best hair transplant doctors list for five consecutive years, providing independent validation of consistently excellent outcomes regardless of hair type or ethnicity.

#### Key Facts

- Investment: From €50,000 / €500,000 fly-out

- Recognition: Ape to Gentleman 5 consecutive years

### 2. Yanhee Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand)

#### Established Medical Tourism Hub

High-volume Thai hospital with affordable pricing.

Yanhee Hospital is one of Bangkok's largest medical tourism destinations, offering hair transplants alongside hundreds of other cosmetic and medical procedures. The hospital processes a high volume of international patients, particularly from neighbouring Asian countries and Australia. Pricing is very competitive at €2,000 to €5,000 for most procedures. The trade-off is a hospital environment with limited privacy and individual attention. Results are adequate for the price point but this is a volume operation.

---

### 3. Dr. Arihiro Kamata (Tokyo, Japan)

#### Japanese Precision and FUE Specialisation

Tokyo-based surgeon known for meticulous technique.

Dr. Arihiro Kamata represents the Japanese approach to hair restoration: meticulous, precise, and detail-oriented. Based in Tokyo, his practice focuses exclusively on FUE procedures with a particular expertise in Asian hair types. Japanese medical standards are exceptionally high, and Dr. Kamata's work reflects this culture of precision. Wait times can be extensive due to his reputation. Investment is premium by Asian standards, typically €10,000 to €20,000, though considerably less than European ultra-premium options.

### 4. DHI (Multiple Asian Cities)

#### Global Franchise with Regional Presence

Consistent technique across Asian locations.

DHI operates franchise locations across major Asian cities including Bangkok, Mumbai, and Jakarta. Their patented Direct Hair Implantation technique uses a specialised tool for graft placement without pre-made recipient sites. The franchise model provides technique consistency but surgeon quality varies by location. Pricing sits in the mid-range for each local market, typically €4,000 to €8,000. The experience is professional and standardised rather than exclusive or personalised.

---

### 5. Absolute Hair Clinic (Bangkok, Thailand)

#### Boutique Thai Clinic with Natural Results Focus

Smaller practice emphasising quality over volume.

Absolute Hair Clinic positions itself as a boutique alternative to Bangkok's large hospital chains. The clinic focuses specifically on hair restoration rather than offering it as one of many services. Their emphasis on natural-looking results differentiates them from volume competitors in the Thai market. The practice handles fewer patients per day than hospital-based options, allowing more individual attention. Investment is moderate at €3,000 to €7,000, reflecting the boutique positioning within Thailand's competitive market.

---

### 6. Aesmed Hair Clinic (Seoul, South Korea)

#### K-Beauty Influenced with Robotic Options

Seoul-based clinic leveraging Korean aesthetic standards.

Aesmed Hair Clinic operates within Seoul's thriving cosmetic surgery ecosystem, bringing Korean aesthetic sensibilities to hair restoration. The clinic offers both manual FUE and robotic-assisted options, appealing to tech-forward clients who prefer automated precision. South Korean medical standards are high, and the clinic operates within a well-regulated environment. The K-beauty influence means strong attention to overall aesthetic harmony. Investment typically ranges from €5,000 to €12,000 depending on technique and graft count.

## Choosing the Best Clinic for Asian Clients

Essential considerations for Asian clients seeking hair restoration.

Asian clients should evaluate these critical factors:

- **Asian hair expertise** - Not all surgeons understand the specific challenges of Asian hair. Ask about their experience with your particular hair type and texture.
- **Angle precision** - Asian hair grows at distinctive angles. Poor angle placement creates an obviously artificial appearance that is difficult to correct.
- **Density planning** - The contrast between dark Asian hair and lighter scalp requires careful density planning to avoid a pluggy appearance.
- **Privacy and discretion** - For business leaders and public figures, ask specifically about privacy protocols and post-procedure concealment strategies.
- **Long-term results** - Request 12+ month results photos specifically from Asian patients. Early results do not predict final outcome.
- **Aftercare logistics** - If travelling internationally, ensure the clinic has robust remote aftercare protocols for your home country.
