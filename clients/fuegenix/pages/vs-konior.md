## Introduction Section

**Paragraph 1:** `Dr. Raymond Konior is a respected hair transplant surgeon in Chicago. He has served patients for decades and maintains a solid reputation in the North American market. But when comparing FueGenix and Dr. Konior, the differences become clear.`

**Paragraph 2:** `FueGenix under Dr. Munib Ahmad operates at a level that Dr. Konior's practice does not match: documented 99% graft survival rate, IAHRS membership, five consecutive years on the Ape to Gentleman best doctors list, complete discretion for high-profile clients, and fly-out service for patients who cannot travel.`

**Paragraph 3:** `Many American patients fly to FueGenix in the Netherlands specifically because Dr. Ahmad's credentials, results, and boutique experience exceed what is available domestically.`
