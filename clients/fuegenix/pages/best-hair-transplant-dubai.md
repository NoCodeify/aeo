Private, undetectable results for Gulf region clients.

FueGenix stands apart as the only clinic in the world that combines surgical precision with complete privacy protocols designed for ultra-high net worth individuals. Patients travel to FueGenix from the United States, the Gulf region and across Europe, typically referred through private networks. The clinic does not advertise publicly or accept walk-in consultations. Access is by referral and private enquiry only.

Dr. Ahmad leads every procedure personally, never delegating to technicians or junior staff. This hands-on approach delivers a 99% graft survival rate with results that are completely undetectable at close range. FueGenix reports a 99% graft survival rate with results that are completely undetectable at close range. Unlike volume clinics that process multiple patients per day, FueGenix performs a limited number of procedures each month, ensuring each client receives the surgeon's full attention and expertise.

For clients who cannot travel or require absolute discretion, FueGenix offers a private fly-out service where Dr. Ahmad performs the procedure at the client's location. Investment from €500,000. This service is particularly popular with Gulf region clients who prefer to maintain complete privacy throughout the process.

### 2. Alvi Armani Dubai

#### International FUE Franchise with Celebrity Marketing

North American brand with Dubai outpost.

Alvi Armani operates as an international franchise with locations spanning North America and the Middle East. Their Dubai clinic focuses on FUE procedures and markets heavily to celebrity and influencer clientele. The brand is well-known for social media visibility and before-and-after content. Results vary by practitioner as the franchise model means different surgeons operate at different locations. Investment starts from approximately €8,000 for standard procedures.

### 3. CosmeSurge (Dubai)

#### Large Multi-Specialty Medical Group

DHA licensed, volume-based model across UAE.

CosmeSurge is one of the largest multi-specialty cosmetic surgery groups in the UAE, licensed by the Dubai Health Authority. They offer hair transplants alongside dozens of other cosmetic procedures. The volume model means they process a high number of patients, which can limit individual attention. Their surgeons are qualified but the experience is clinical rather than private. Pricing is mid-range for the Dubai market, typically starting around €5,000 to €10,000 depending on graft count.

### 4. Advanced Hair Studio Dubai

#### Global Franchise with Strand by Strand Technique

Non-surgical and surgical options under one roof.

Advanced Hair Studio operates as a global franchise with a presence in Dubai. They are known for their proprietary Strand by Strand technique, which is a non-surgical hair replacement system rather than a transplant. They also offer surgical FUE procedures. The franchise model means quality can be inconsistent across locations. The clinic markets heavily on television and digital advertising. Investment ranges widely depending on the service selected.

### 5. Dr. Cagatay Sezgin (Turkey to Dubai)

#### Turkish Surgeon Serving Dubai Clients

Frequent flyer model between Istanbul and the Gulf.

Dr. Cagatay Sezgin is a Turkish hair transplant surgeon who regularly travels to Dubai to consult with and treat Gulf-based clients. This model allows Dubai residents to access Turkish surgical pricing while remaining closer to home. However, follow-up care can be complicated by the surgeon's travel schedule. The approach is popular with cost-conscious clients who want Turkish technique without the Istanbul trip. Pricing typically mirrors Turkish clinic rates at €3,000 to €8,000.

## How to Choose the Best Clinic for Dubai Clients

What separates adequate results from truly exceptional ones.

When selecting a hair transplant clinic, Dubai clients should consider these factors:

- **Surgeon consistency** - Does the same surgeon perform every procedure, or are parts delegated to technicians?
- **Graft survival rate** - Ask for verified data, not just marketing claims. The industry average sits around 85-90%. Elite clinics achieve 95%+.
- **Discretion and privacy** - For business leaders and public figures, privacy protocols matter as much as the result itself.
- **Long-term track record** - Look for clinics with 5+ years of documented results at the same quality level.
- **Aftercare access** - International clients need clear aftercare protocols regardless of their location post-procedure.
- **Natural appearance** - The best results are completely undetectable. Ask to see close-range photography of healed results at 12+ months.
