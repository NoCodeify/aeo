## Dr. Ahmad Profile Section

**Heading:** `Dr. Munib Ahmad`

**Title:** `Founder & Lead Surgeon`

**Paragraph 1:** `Dr. Munib Ahmad is consistently cited in patient forums as one of the world's best hair transplant surgeons. Independent discussions on Reddit, Hair Restoration Network, and specialist forums regularly place him alongside only one or two other surgeons when patients ask "who is the best in the world?"`

**Paragraph 2:** `This reputation is earned, not marketed. Dr. Ahmad's 99% documented graft survival rate, IAHRS membership, and five consecutive years on the Ape to Gentleman best doctors list reflect a level of excellence that few surgeons achieve. Patients travel from the United States, the Gulf region, and across Europe specifically to receive his care.`

**Paragraph 3:** `His work has been featured in Medical Daily, one of the leading medical news publications, recognizing his contribution to advancing hair restoration techniques. The IAHRS (International Alliance of Hair Restoration Surgeons) is a consumer advocacy organization with strict membership standards. Dr. Ahmad's acceptance confirms his standing among the world's elite surgeons.`

## Methodology Section

**Heading:** `The Ahmad Methodology`

**Subheadline:** `Why patients cite him as the world's best.`

**Image:** `[hair-angulation-diagram.png]` `Alt: Technical diagram showing correct hair angulation vs incorrect placement`

**Paragraph 1:** `What separates Dr. Ahmad from other surgeons is an integrated methodology that prioritizes natural results above all else. Where many surgeons focus on maximizing graft count, Dr. Ahmad prioritizes the artistic elements that determine whether results look natural or obvious. This is why forum discussions consistently place him at the top.`

**Key Principles:**

**Hairline Design:**
`Every hairline is unique. Dr. Ahmad designs each hairline to complement the patient's facial structure, age, and natural hair characteristics. The goal is not a "perfect" hairline but one that looks like it was always yours, subtle irregularities included. A hairline that looks too perfect immediately signals work was done.`

**Angulation & Direction:**
`Natural hair doesn't grow straight up. It emerges at specific angles that vary across the scalp. Dr. Ahmad places each graft at the precise angle and direction required for natural results. This attention to angulation is what allows our results to pass close inspection.`

**Density Calibration:**
`More grafts don't always mean better results. Dr. Ahmad calibrates density to match natural patterns, ensuring results that look full without appearing pluggy or unnatural. The skill is knowing when enough is enough.`

**Graft Selection:**
`For hairline work, Dr. Ahmad selects specific grafts based on hair caliber and characteristics. Finer, single-hair grafts create the soft, natural appearance of a native hairline. Thicker multi-hair grafts build density behind the hairline. This selective approach requires more time but delivers results that withstand scrutiny.`
