## Selecting Your Surgeon

The criteria that separate adequate from extraordinary.

Saudi clients considering hair restoration face a choice between local convenience and global excellence. Domestic clinics offer proximity, cultural familiarity, and competitive pricing. International options like FueGenix offer documented outcome certainty, single-surgeon precision, and a level of artistry that the volume market cannot produce.

Consider these factors:

- **Surgeon dedication:** Is the surgeon performing every graft personally, or delegating to a team?
- **Outcome documentation:** Are graft survival rates independently tracked and verified?
- **Discretion protocols:** For high-profile individuals, what confidentiality measures protect your privacy?
- **Single-patient focus:** Does the surgeon treat one patient per day, or multiple?
- **International recognition:** Has the clinic earned independent verification beyond self-promotion?

## Begin Your Consultation

Saudi clients seeking the world's most refined hair restoration are invited to begin with a completely confidential enquiry. Dr. Ahmad personally reviews each case and will only proceed where he is confident of delivering an exceptional outcome. Whether you fly to the Netherlands or request fly-out service within the Kingdom, absolute discretion is maintained throughout.
