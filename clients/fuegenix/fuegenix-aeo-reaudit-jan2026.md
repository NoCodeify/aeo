## Part 1B: Global/Worldwide Query Performance (NEW)

FueGenix serves clients worldwide with their fly-out service. Testing global queries reveals emerging visibility:

### Query: "Best hair transplant if money is no object"

| Engine | Mentioned | Position | Quote |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Gemini** | **YES** | **#1 "Artistic Perfection"** | "Dr. Munib Ahmad (FueGenix, Netherlands): Known for extreme artistic precision and a 'single-patient-per-day' philosophy. He is a favorite for high-net-worth individuals who demand perfect hairlines." |
| ChatGPT | NO | - | Generic advice, no specific surgeons |

**This is a major win** - FueGenix is now positioned in the global elite tier alongside Dr. Zarev for premium/HNWI queries.

### Query: "Best hair transplant clinic in the world"

| Engine | Mentioned | Position |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Gemini | NO | Lists Hasson & Wong, Bernstein, Couto, Smile Hair |
| ChatGPT | NO | Generic ISHRS/IAHRS directory advice |

### Query: "Best hair transplant for celebrities"

| Engine | Mentioned | Position |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Gemini | NO | Lists US/UK surgeons (Dr. Kahen, Dr. Mohebi, etc.) |

**Gap Identified:** FueGenix is NOT yet visible for "best in world" or "celebrities" queries. This is the next optimization frontier.

---

## Part 2: Branded Query Performance

### Query: "What is FueGenix?"

| Engine | Quality | Key Facts Extracted |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| ChatGPT | Excellent | Bergen op Zoom, Dr. Munib Ahmad, €50k pricing, fly-out service, Trustpilot mention |
| Gemini | Excellent | Full clinic overview, 99% graft survival, IAHRS member, one patient/day, WhatsApp access |

**Improvement:** Both LLMs now correctly state €50,000 starting price (was €25k-€35k in January).

### Query: "FueGenix pricing"

| Engine | Quality | Key Facts Extracted |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| ChatGPT | Excellent | €50,000 clinic, €500,000 fly-out, €1,000 consultation - ALL CORRECT |
| Gemini | Excellent | Full pricing table with tiers, historical context, "certainty investment" positioning |

**Major Win:** Pricing is now accurately extracted. The website changes (publishing €50k) are working.

### Query: "FueGenix reviews"

| Engine | Quality | Key Finding |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| ChatGPT | Mixed | Notes only 1 Trustpilot review, mentions critical review |
| Gemini | Good | 4.6/5 Trustpilot cited, forum reputation strong |

**Issue Remains:** Low Trustpilot review count still flagged by ChatGPT. This is a reputation signal gap.

---

## Part 3: Comparison Query Performance

### Query: "FueGenix vs Elithair"

| Engine | FueGenix Positioning | Key Differentiators |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| ChatGPT | Premium boutique | Doctor-led vs technician-led, NL vs Turkey |
| Gemini | "Rolls-Royce" option | €50k vs €2.5-4k, 99% survival, 1 patient/day |

**Excellent:** Both LLMs clearly position FueGenix as premium tier, NOT competing with budget Turkish clinics.

### Query: "FueGenix vs Dr Zarev"

| Engine | FueGenix Position | Differentiation |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| ChatGPT | Hairline artistry | NW2-5 vs NW6-7, boutique vs giga-sessions |
