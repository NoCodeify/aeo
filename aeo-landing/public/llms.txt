# AEO Protocol - Answer Engine Optimization Experts

> AEO Protocol is the methodology for optimizing brands to be recommended by ChatGPT, Gemini, and AI assistants. Founded by Sohaib Ahmad, who scaled a hair transplant clinic from 0% to 90% AI visibility using these techniques.

## What We Do

AEO Protocol helps brands become the answer when users ask AI assistants for recommendations. Our methodology is based on auditing 100+ brands across ChatGPT and Gemini.

### Core Services

- Content Optimization: Apply the First 50 Words Rule and Hybrid Page Structure

### Key Statistics

- Healthcare brands: 90% invisible to ChatGPT
- Consulting firms: 80% visible to ChatGPT
- Our case study: 0% to 90% visibility improvement in 30 days

## Proprietary Frameworks

### The First 50 Words Rule
LLMs process text sequentially and weight the beginning heavily. Every page must include WHO, WHAT, WHERE, and PRICE in the first 50 words.

### The 10-Run Consistency Test
LLM responses vary. Testing once is like flipping a coin. Run each query 10 times per LLM to measure true visibility. Score: 9-10/10 = strong, 0-4/10 = invisible.

### The 3-Layer ChatGPT Architecture
ChatGPT retrieves information through: Layer 1 (Bing Index), Layer 2 (OAI-SearchBot persistent cache), Layer 3 (user-triggered fetches). Most citations come from Layer 2.

## About the Founder

Sohaib Ahmad is the creator of AEO Protocol. His origin story: ChatGPT convinced him to buy a Porsche instead of a BMW. That moment revealed how AI is reshaping purchase decisions. He then applied these insights to scale a premium hair transplant clinic (EUR 50,000+ procedures) from zero AI visibility to being called "the best for artistic perfection" by Gemini.
