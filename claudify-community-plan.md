# Claudify Community Content Plan

The Claudify Skool community content structure. Designed to launch lean (8 modules) and expand 1-2 modules per month based on member demand. Overwhelm is the #1 driver of Skool churn - this plan prevents it.

**Key constraints:**
- No free tier. YouTube is the free content, everything in Skool is behind $97/mo.
- Video lesson format for all modules.
- Three tracks: build for yourself, build a product, build a service.
- 21-day milestone: structured onboarding path to a first working system (not a refund guarantee).
- Launch with enough to feel substantial, not enough to overwhelm.

## 1. Skool Classroom Structure

### Category: 21-Day Quick Start

Every new member starts here. Linear, no choices to make. The structured onboarding path that gives new members direction and momentum.

| # | Module | What they build | Day |
|---|--------|----------------|-----|
| 1 | Welcome + Setup | Claude Code installed, terminal running | Day 1 |
| 2 | Your First Session | Complete a real task with Claude Code | Day 2-3 |
| 3 | CLAUDE.md: Your Project's Brain | A CLAUDE.md for their own project | Day 4-6 |
| 4 | Your First Real System | A working automation/tool for their actual work | Day 7-14 |
| 5 | When Things Go Wrong | Debug skills, context management, recovery | Day 15-18 |
| 6 | Pick Your Track | Choose: build for yourself / product / service | Day 19-21 |

**Module 4 is the key module.** This is where the 21-day milestone lives or dies. Members pick ONE real thing from their work (not a tutorial project) and build it with Claude Code. Coaching calls during weeks 2-3 focus heavily on helping people through this module.

### Category: FoundationKit

Unlocked after Quick Start (or browse freely). Added over time, 1-2 per month based on demand.

| # | Module | Prerequisite |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 7 | Custom Slash Commands & Skills | Quick Start |
| 8 | Building Agents | Quick Start |
| 9 | MCP Servers | Module 8 |
| 10 | Multi-Agent Teams | Module 8 |
| 11 | Hooks & Automation Triggers | Quick Start |
| 12 | Claude Code for Research & Analysis | Quick Start |
| 13 | Claude Code for Content & Marketing | Quick Start |
| 14 | Building Internal Tools & Dashboards | Quick Start |
| 15 | Advanced Patterns (git worktrees, parallel sessions) | Module 10 |

### Category: CaseStudyOS

Released 1 per month. Each based on the founder's actual production systems.

| # | Case Study | What members learn |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| CS1 | DMChamp: $100K SaaS | Full SaaS lifecycle with Claude Code - pricing, deployment, maintenance |
| CS2 | Agentic CI/CD Pipeline | Automated bug detection, fix, customer notification flow |
| CS3 | AEO Consulting Business | Building a consulting delivery system with agents + MCP |
| CS4 | NFC Smart Lock | Hardware/firmware - proving Claude Code goes beyond software |
| CS5 | Video Production & Outreach Stack | Content pipeline, cold outreach, marketing automation |

### Category: The Vault

Not video modules. Downloadable resources organized by type:

- CLAUDE.md templates (by industry/use case)
- Agent configuration files
- Skill templates
- Project structure starters
- Prompt libraries for common tasks

### Category: ServiceKit

For members on the service track (Track C).

| # | Module | Content |
|---|--------|---------|
| SK1 | The Claude Code Service Menu | What you can sell, at what price points |
| SK2 | Scoping & Discovery | How to scope a Claude Code implementation project |
| SK3 | Pricing & Packaging | $2-5K project packages, retainer models |
| SK4 | Client Delivery | How to deliver, communicate, and hand off |
| SK5 | Finding & Closing Clients | Outreach, proposals, closing |

---

## 2. Launch Content (Day 1)

The minimum viable community. Enough to deliver on the 21-day milestone, show depth, and tease future content.

**Must-have at launch:**

- 21-Day Quick Start: All 6 modules (video lessons)
- CaseStudyOS: CS1 (DMChamp) - the flagship case study
- The Vault: 3-5 CLAUDE.md templates, 2-3 agent configs
- ServiceKit: SK1 (Service Menu overview)
- Welcome video from the founder
- Community spaces set up (see section 4)
- First coaching call scheduled

**Total launch effort: 8 video modules + templates + community setup**

This is enough to:
- Deliver on the 21-day milestone (Quick Start path)
- Show depth (DMChamp case study is substantial)
- Give templates to start immediately (Vault)
- Tease the service pathway (SK1)

---

## 3. Monthly Content Roadmap

| Month | New Modules | Case Study | Vault Additions |
|-------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Launch | Quick Start (6) + SK1 | CS1: DMChamp | 5 CLAUDE.md templates, 3 agent configs |
| Month 2 | Module 7 (Commands/Skills) + Module 8 (Agents) | CS2: CI/CD Pipeline | Skill templates, hook examples |
| Month 3 | Module 9 (MCP) + SK2 (Scoping) | - | MCP server starters |
| Month 4 | Module 11 (Hooks) + SK3 (Pricing) | CS3: AEO Consulting | Client proposal templates |
| Month 5 | Module 10 (Multi-Agent) + Module 12 (Research) | - | Research workflow templates |
| Month 6 | Module 13 (Content) + SK4 (Delivery) + SK5 (Closing) | CS4: NFC Lock | Delivery checklist templates |
| Month 7+ | Module 14 (Dashboards), Module 15 (Advanced), demand-driven | CS5: Video/Outreach | Ongoing |

**Key principle: every month has something new.** Members always have a reason to stay. But it is 1-2 modules per month, not 5. Digestible.

---

## 4. Community Spaces (Skool Feed Categories)

| Space | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Announcements | New modules, updates, events (founder only) |
| Wins | Members share what they built (celebration + social proof) |
| Help & Debug | Get unstuck, share errors, ask questions |
| Show Your Work | Share work-in-progress, get feedback |
| Ideas & Requests | Members request modules, features, templates |
| Coaching Call Replays | Recordings of weekly calls |
| Introductions | New member intros (who are you, what do you want to build) |

---

## 5. Weekly Cadence

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Monday | Weekly challenge posted (small, specific, doable in 1-2 hours) |
| Tuesday-Wednesday | Founder active in Help & Debug + community feed |
| Thursday evening | Weekly live coaching call (60-90 min, screen-share, build together) |
| Friday | "What I built this week" Loom from the founder (5-10 min) |
| Weekend | Community self-serves; founder responds async |

### Weekly coaching call format

1. Quick wins round (5 min) - members share what they shipped
2. Hot seat #1 (20 min) - member shares screen, builds/debugs live with founder
3. Hot seat #2 (20 min) - second member
4. Open Q&A (15-20 min) - rapid-fire questions
5. Next week preview (5 min) - what is coming

---

## 6. Onboarding Flow (First 21 Days)

| When | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| Join | Welcome DM from founder (personal, not automated bot voice) |
| Join | Auto-tagged to "New Member" - gets pinned onboarding post |
| Day 1 | Watch Module 1 (Setup). Post intro in Introductions. |
| Day 1 | Encouraged to attend next coaching call (or watch replay) |
| Day 2-3 | Module 2 (First Session). Share first win in Wins channel. |
| Day 4-6 | Module 3 (CLAUDE.md). Share their CLAUDE.md in Show Your Work. |
| Day 7 | Module 4 starts (the real build). Founder checks in via DM. |
| Day 14 | Module 4 should be complete. Founder follows up. |
| Day 21 | Milestone checkpoint. Member should have a working system. |

The founder DM at Day 7 and Day 14 is critical for retention. Personal touch in the first 21 days is what prevents early churn.

## 7. Gamification & Retention

### Skool built-in

- Levels (based on engagement points)
- Leaderboard (visible to all members)
- Points for posting, commenting, completing modules

### Custom retention mechanics

- **21-Day Quick Start badge** - complete Quick Start = badge + leaderboard points
- **Monthly build challenges** - themed (e.g. "Automate one thing you hate doing this week")
- **Member spotlight** - featured in Announcements when they ship something notable
- **"First $1K" milestone** - for Track C members who close their first service client
- **Coaching call attendance streak** - bonus points for showing up consistently

### Anti-churn triggers

- If a member has not logged in for 7 days: founder DM ("Hey, saw you started Module X - need help?")
- If a member is stuck on Module 4 for 14+ days: invite to coaching call hot seat
- Monthly "what's your next build?" prompt in the feed (keeps people forward-looking)

## 8. Track-Specific Paths

The three tracks share the same Quick Start and FoundationKit. They diverge at Module 6 ("Pick Your Track") with recommended paths.

### Track A: Build for Yourself

Quick Start -> Module 7 (Commands) -> Module 8 (Agents) -> Module 14 (Dashboards) -> CS1 (DMChamp for inspiration)

Goal: internal tools, custom workflows, replace SaaS subscriptions.

### Track B: Build a Product

Quick Start -> Module 8 (Agents) -> Module 9 (MCP) -> Module 10 (Multi-Agent) -> CS1 (DMChamp as blueprint)

Goal: ship a SaaS or tool that generates revenue.

### Track C: Build a Service

Quick Start -> ServiceKit (all modules) -> Module 8 (Agents) -> CS3 (AEO as service template)

Goal: package and sell Claude Code implementation services.

Tracks are recommendations, not gatekeeping. Any member can access any module.

## 9. What This Changes in Existing Docs

### new-plan-wip-draft.md

- Remove free Skool tier (Layer 3). YouTube is the free content. No free community.
- Update module numbering to match this plan (Quick Start 1-6, FoundationKit 7-15, CaseStudyOS CS1-CS5, ServiceKit SK1-SK5).
- Remove "refund guarantee" / "money back" language from the guarantee section. Reframe as a 21-day structured milestone.
- Update 90-day action plan to reflect no free tier launch.

### claudify-brand-copy.md

- Remove "or your money back" from About section and landing page one-liner.
- Rewrite guarantee section: "Build your first working system in 21 days" as a structured path, not a refund promise. The 21-day Quick Start gives members a clear, guided path to their first working Claude Code system. If they follow the modules, attend coaching calls, and do the work, they will have a working system by Day 21. That is the promise.
- Update risk reversal line on landing page accordingly.
- "20+ modules" is fine as a forward-looking statement (the full curriculum reaches 20+ by Month 7).
