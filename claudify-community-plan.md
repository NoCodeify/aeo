# Claudify Community Content Plan

The Claudify Skool community content structure. Designed to launch lean (8 modules) and expand 1-2 modules per month based on member demand. Overwhelm is the #1 driver of Skool churn - this plan prevents it.

**Key constraints:**
- No free tier. YouTube is the free content, everything in Skool is behind $97/mo.
- Video lesson format for all modules.
- Three tracks: build for yourself, build a product, build a service.
- 21-day milestone: structured onboarding path to a first working system (not a refund guarantee).
- Launch with enough to feel substantial, not enough to overwhelm.

## 1. Skool Classroom Structure

### Category: 21-Day Quick Start

Every new member starts here. Linear, no choices to make. The structured onboarding path that gives new members direction and momentum.

**Rule: Do not skip ahead.** Trust the process. Each day builds on the previous one. Members who rush through modules miss the community actions and coaching that make the difference. (Inspired by CoderCo's "clean completion" philosophy.)

| # | Module | What they build | Day |
|---|--------|----------------|-----|
| 1 | Welcome + Setup | Claude Code installed, terminal running | Day 1 |
| 2 | Your First Session | Complete a real task with Claude Code | Day 2-3 |
| 3 | CLAUDE.md: Your Project's Brain | A CLAUDE.md for their own project | Day 4-6 |
| 4 | Your First Real System | A working automation/tool for their actual work | Day 7-14 |
| 5 | When Things Go Wrong | Debug skills, context management, recovery | Day 15-18 |
| 6 | Pick Your Track | Choose: build for yourself / product / service | Day 19-21 |

**Module 4 is the key module.** This is where the 21-day milestone lives or dies. Members pick ONE real thing from their work (not a tutorial project) and build it with Claude Code. Coaching calls during weeks 2-3 focus heavily on helping people through this module.

#### Day-by-Day Pacing (21 Days)

Same 6 modules, but with daily milestones, check-ins, and community actions between modules. This prevents "I watched all 6 videos in one sitting and don't know what to do next."

**Week 1: Foundation (Modules 1-3)**

| Day | Module | Action | Community |
|-----|--------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Module 1: Setup | Install Claude Code, configure terminal, run first command | Post intro in Introductions ("who I am, what I want to build") |
| 2 | Module 2: First Session | Watch module. Pick ONE real task from your actual work | Reply to someone else's intro in Introductions |
| 3 | Module 2 (continued) | Complete the task. Screenshot the result | Post first win in Wins ("I just did X with Claude Code") |
| 4 | Module 3: CLAUDE.md | Watch module. Start writing a CLAUDE.md for your project | Browse Show Your Work, see what others are building |
| 5 | Module 3 (continued) | Finish your CLAUDE.md. Test it: start a new session and see if Claude understands your project | Post your CLAUDE.md in Show Your Work for feedback |
| 6 | Module 3 (continued) | Refine based on community feedback. Add project-specific rules | Attend coaching call replay if you missed Thursday |
| 7 | Rest / catch up | Review what you built this week. Read 3 posts in Help & Debug | Founder DM check-in: "How's the first week going?" |

**Week 2: The Build (Module 4, Part 1)**

| Day | Action | Community |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| 8 | Module 4: Watch the full module. Pick your ONE real system to build | Post in Show Your Work: "Here's what I'm building and why" |
| 9 | Start building. Focus on the simplest version that works | Ask one question in Help & Debug (even if you don't need to - practice asking) |
| 10 | Keep building. Hit your first wall. That's normal | Post your wall in Help & Debug. Someone has hit it before you |
| 11 | Attend The Build Lab (Thursday). Bring your project if you're stuck | If not attending live, post a specific question for the replay |
| 12 | Apply what you learned from The Build Lab. Push through the wall | Watch Friday Ship Log. Reply with your own progress |
| 13 | Keep building. Your system should be partially working by now | Post a progress update in Show Your Work |
| 14 | End of Week 2 checkpoint. Your system should do at least ONE useful thing | Founder DM follow-up: "How's the build going? Need a hot seat?" |

**Week 3: Polish + Pick Your Track (Modules 5-6)**

| Day | Action | Community |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| 15 | Module 5: When Things Go Wrong. Watch the module | Try to break your system on purpose. Document what happens |
| 16 | Fix what you broke. Practice the debug/recovery patterns | Post your debug story in Help & Debug (helps future members) |
| 17 | Polish your system. Add error handling from Module 5 | Browse the weekly challenge. Try it if you have time |
| 18 | Your system should be working and handling edge cases | Post your completed system in Wins with a short writeup |
| 19 | Module 6: Pick Your Track. Watch the module | Decide: Track A (build for yourself), B (product), C (service) |
| 20 | Start exploring your chosen track's first module | Post in Show Your Work: "I picked Track [X] because..." |
| 21 | Milestone day. You have a working system. Celebrate | Post your 21-day milestone in Wins. Badge unlocked |

### Category: Foundations

Unlocked after Quick Start (or browse freely). Added over time, 1-2 per month based on demand.

| # | Module | Prerequisite |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 7 | Custom Slash Commands & Skills | Quick Start |
| 8 | Building Agents | Quick Start |
| 9 | MCP Servers | Module 8 |
| 10 | Multi-Agent Teams | Module 8 |
| 11 | Hooks & Automation Triggers | Quick Start |
| 12 | Claude Code for Research & Analysis | Quick Start |
| 13 | Claude Code for Content & Marketing | Quick Start |
| 14 | Building Internal Tools & Dashboards | Quick Start |
| 15 | Advanced Patterns (git worktrees, parallel sessions) | Module 10 |

### Category: Case Studies

Released 1 per month. Each based on the founder's actual production systems.

| # | Case Study | What members learn |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| CS1 | DMChamp: $100K SaaS | Full SaaS lifecycle with Claude Code - pricing, deployment, maintenance |
| CS2 | Agentic CI/CD Pipeline | Automated bug detection, fix, customer notification flow |
| CS3 | AEO Consulting Business | Building a consulting delivery system with agents + MCP |
| CS4 | NFC Smart Lock | Hardware/firmware - proving Claude Code goes beyond software |
| CS5 | Video Production & Outreach Stack | Content pipeline, cold outreach, marketing automation |

### Category: The Vault (Annual Members Only)

Production-grade templates and files pulled directly from the founder's systems. Monthly members learn everything they need from the Classroom. Annual members get the shortcuts: ready-to-copy production files that save weeks of setup time.

**This is the genuine value gap between monthly and annual.** Monthly members learn how to build. Annual members get files they can copy and ship with today.

Contents:
- CLAUDE.md templates (by industry/use case)
- Agent configuration files
- Skill templates
- Project structure starters

### Category: Service Track

For members on the service track (Track C). Open to all members (monthly and annual). Released progressively via the monthly content roadmap.

| # | Module | Content |
|---|--------|---------|
| SK1 | The Claude Code Service Menu | What you can sell, at what price points |
| SK2 | Scoping & Discovery | How to scope a Claude Code implementation project |
| SK3 | Pricing & Packaging | $2-5K project packages, retainer models |
| SK4 | Client Delivery | How to deliver, communicate, and hand off |
| SK5 | Finding & Closing Clients | Outreach, proposals, closing |

---

## 2. Launch Content (Day 1)

The minimum viable community. Enough to deliver on the 21-day milestone, show depth, and tease future content.

**Must-have at launch:**

- Orientation video: "Welcome to Claudify" (10-15 min, see Section 6)
- 21-Day Quick Start: All 6 modules (video lessons)
- Case Studies: CS1 (DMChamp) - the flagship case study
- The Vault: 3-5 CLAUDE.md templates, 2-3 agent configs (annual members only)
- Service Track: SK1 (Service Menu overview)
- Community spaces set up with posting guidelines (see Section 4)
- First Build Lab call scheduled

**Total launch effort: orientation video + 8 video modules + templates + community setup**

This is enough to:
- Deliver on the 21-day milestone (Quick Start path)
- Show depth (DMChamp case study is substantial)
- Give templates to start immediately (Vault for annual members)
- Tease the service pathway (SK1)

---

## 3. Monthly Content Roadmap

| Month | New Modules | Case Study | Vault Additions (Annual Only) |
|-------|------------|------------|-------------------------------|
| Launch | Quick Start (6) + SK1 | CS1: DMChamp | 5 CLAUDE.md templates, 3 agent configs |
| Month 2 | Module 7 (Commands/Skills) + Module 8 (Agents) | CS2: CI/CD Pipeline | Skill templates, hook examples |
| Month 3 | Module 9 (MCP) + SK2 (Scoping) | - | MCP server starters |
| Month 4 | Module 11 (Hooks) + SK3 (Pricing) | CS3: AEO Consulting | Client proposal templates |
| Month 5 | Module 10 (Multi-Agent) + Module 12 (Research) | - | Research workflow templates |
| Month 6 | Module 13 (Content) + SK4 (Delivery) + SK5 (Closing) | CS4: NFC Lock | Delivery checklist templates |
| Month 7+ | Module 14 (Dashboards), Module 15 (Advanced), demand-driven | CS5: Video/Outreach | Ongoing |

**Key principle: every month has something new.** Members always have a reason to stay. But it is 1-2 modules per month, not 5. Digestible.

---

## 4. Community Spaces (Skool Feed Categories)

| Space | Purpose | Posting Guidelines |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Announcements | New modules, updates, events (founder only) | Founder posts only. Members comment, don't post |
| Wins | Members share what they built (celebration + social proof) | Post what you shipped + a short writeup of what it does. Screenshots encouraged |
| Help & Debug | Get unstuck, share errors, ask questions | Include: what you tried, what happened, what you expected. Paste error messages, not screenshots of errors |
| Show Your Work | Share work-in-progress, get feedback | Share early and often. No need to be finished. Include context on what you're building and why |
| Ideas & Requests | Members request modules, features, templates | One idea per post. Upvote existing requests before creating duplicates |
| Coaching Call Replays | Recordings of weekly Build Lab calls | Watch first, then comment with questions or follow-ups |
| Introductions | New member intros (who are you, what do you want to build) | Template: "I'm [name], I [what I do], I want to build [specific thing]" |

**Before posting, ask yourself: where does this belong?** Each space has a pinned post explaining its purpose. Using the right space keeps the community clean and makes it easier for members to find answers.

## 5. Weekly Cadence

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Monday | Weekly challenge posted (small, specific, doable in 1-2 hours) |
| Tuesday-Wednesday | Founder active in Help & Debug + community feed |
| Thursday evening | **The Build Lab** - Weekly live coaching call (60-90 min) |
| Friday | **Friday Ship Log** - Founder shares what he built that week with Claude Code (5-10 min Loom). Members reply with their own ship logs |
| Weekend | Community self-serves; founder responds async |

### The Build Lab (Thursday Coaching Call)

A named, recurring event. Not just "weekly coaching" but a signature community ritual. Rotating format keeps it fresh:

| Week | Format | What happens |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Week 1 | Hot Seats | 2-3 members share screen, build/debug live with founder |
| Week 2 | CLAUDE.md Roast | Member submits their CLAUDE.md, founder tears it apart live. Brutally honest, immediately actionable |
| Week 3 | Hot Seats | Same as Week 1 |
| Week 4 | Project Teardown | Member demos what they built, founder critiques architecture, patterns, and next steps |

Every Build Lab follows this structure:
1. Quick wins round (5 min) - members share what they shipped
2. Main format (40-50 min) - hot seats, roast, or teardown
3. Open Q&A (15-20 min) - rapid-fire questions
4. Next week preview (5 min) - what's coming

### Friday Ship Log

The founder records a 5-10 min Loom every Friday showing what he built that week with Claude Code. Not polished, not scripted. Raw building. Members are encouraged to reply with their own ship logs (text, screenshots, or Loom).

This creates a weekly rhythm of building and shipping. When members see the founder shipping every week, it normalizes consistent output.

---

## 6. Onboarding Flow (First 21 Days)

### Orientation Video: "Welcome to Claudify" (10-15 min)

Every new member watches this BEFORE starting Module 1. It tours the platform and sets expectations. Separate from the Quick Start curriculum. (Inspired by CoderCo's 20-min orientation.)

What it covers:
1. **What Claudify is** (2 min) - Not a course. A structured system with live support and a community of builders
2. **The 4 areas** (5 min) - Tour the Classroom, The Vault (annual), Community spaces, and The Build Lab
3. **The 21-day path** (3 min) - Overview of the day-by-day Quick Start. Set expectations: 30-60 minutes per day
4. **Ground rules** (2 min) - Do not skip ahead. Use the right community space. Show up to The Build Lab. Post your work
5. **What to do right now** (2 min) - Watch Module 1. Post your intro. Attend the next Build Lab (or watch the replay)

### Day-by-Day Onboarding Touchpoints

| When | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| Join | Welcome DM from founder (personal, not automated bot voice) |
| Join | Auto-tagged to "New Member" - gets pinned onboarding post pointing to orientation video |
| Join | Watch orientation video ("Welcome to Claudify") |
| Day 1 | Watch Module 1 (Setup). Post intro in Introductions |
| Day 1 | Encouraged to attend next Build Lab (or watch replay) |
| Day 2-3 | Module 2 (First Session). Share first win in Wins channel |
| Day 4-6 | Module 3 (CLAUDE.md). Share their CLAUDE.md in Show Your Work |
| Day 7 | Module 4 starts (the real build). Founder checks in via DM |
| Day 14 | Module 4 should be complete. Founder follows up via DM |
| Day 21 | Milestone checkpoint. Member should have a working system |

The founder DM at Day 7 and Day 14 is critical for retention. Personal touch in the first 21 days is what prevents early churn.

## 7. Gamification & Retention

### Skool built-in

- Levels (based on engagement points)
- Leaderboard (visible to all members)
- Points for posting, commenting, completing modules

### Custom retention mechanics

- **21-Day Quick Start badge** - complete Quick Start = badge + leaderboard points
- **Monthly build challenges** - themed (e.g. "Automate one thing you hate doing this week")
- **Member spotlight** - featured in Announcements when they ship something notable
- **"First $1K" milestone** - for Track C members who close their first service client
- **Coaching call attendance streak** - bonus points for showing up to The Build Lab consistently
- **Friday Ship Log streak** - bonus points for posting ship logs 3+ weeks in a row

### Retention levers

**Price lock.** The price you join at today is yours for life. When the price increases (see Pricing section), early members keep their original rate. This rewards loyalty and creates genuine urgency for new members.

**The Vault (annual-exclusive).** Monthly members get the full Classroom, community, and Build Lab. Annual members also get The Vault (production templates, CLAUDE.md files, agent configs, project starters), 1-on-1 project reviews, priority access on Build Lab calls, and 2 months free. The Vault is the main incentive to commit annually. Monthly members learn everything they need. Annual members get the shortcuts.

**Consistent new content.** Every month has at least 1-2 new modules. Members always have something new to work through. No "I've seen everything" feeling.

### Anti-churn triggers

- If a member has not logged in for 7 days: founder DM ("Hey, saw you started Module X - need help?")
- If a member is stuck on Module 4 for 14+ days: invite to Build Lab hot seat
- Monthly "what's your next build?" prompt in the feed (keeps people forward-looking)

## 8. Track-Specific Paths

The three tracks share the same Quick Start and Foundations. They diverge at Module 6 ("Pick Your Track") with recommended paths.

### Track A: Build for Yourself

Quick Start -> Module 7 (Commands) -> Module 8 (Agents) -> Module 14 (Dashboards) -> CS1 (DMChamp for inspiration)

Goal: internal tools, custom workflows, replace SaaS subscriptions.

### Track B: Build a Product

Quick Start -> Module 8 (Agents) -> Module 9 (MCP) -> Module 10 (Multi-Agent) -> CS1 (DMChamp as blueprint)

Goal: ship a SaaS or tool that generates revenue.

### Track C: Build a Service

Quick Start -> Service Track (all modules) -> Module 8 (Agents) -> CS3 (AEO as service template)

Goal: package and sell Claude Code implementation services.

Tracks are recommendations, not gatekeeping. Any member can access any module.

---

## 9. Pricing

### Monthly: $97/mo

What you get:
- 21-Day Quick Start (full curriculum)
- Foundations (20+ modules, released monthly)
- Case Studies (5 real-world breakdowns)
- Service Track (all modules)
- The Build Lab (weekly live coaching)
- Friday Ship Log
- All community spaces
- Weekly challenges

### Annual: $970/yr (2 months free)

Everything in monthly, PLUS:
- **The Vault** - Production-grade templates, CLAUDE.md files, agent configs, project starters
- **1-on-1 project review** with the founder
- **Priority access** on Build Lab calls
- **2 months free** (12 months for the price of 10)

### Price Increase Plan

One real price increase from $97 to $117 at a meaningful milestone (100 or 200 members). Not a recurring tactic. Not "prices go up every week" urgency theatre.

- Early members lock in $97/mo for life
- New members after the increase pay $117/mo
- Annual adjusts proportionally ($970 -> $1,170)
- Communicate honestly: "We increased the price because the community is bigger and the content library is deeper. If you joined early, you keep your original rate forever"

This creates real urgency for prospective members without the dishonesty of manufactured scarcity.
