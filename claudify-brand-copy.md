## Name
Claudify

What used to take a team or an expert now takes a subscription.

## Transformation phrase
From needing a team and an expert to being both.

## Short Description (Skool discovery / bio)

Run a consulting agency. Ship a $100K SaaS. Deliver services that used to need a dev team or a specialist. All from one person with Claude Code. Claudify is where professionals and business owners learn what's actually possible - and how to do it.

## About Section (Skool community page)

Ready to do things in 2026 that used to require a dev team, a specialist, or a six-figure budget?

Built a $100K/yr SaaS, a self-healing CI/CD pipeline, and a full consulting delivery system with Claude Code. Zero dev background. Now teaching others to do the same. First working system in 21 days.

---

**The proof.**

The founder didn't learn this from a course. He built it:

- DMChamp - a SaaS generating $100K/yr in revenue, with real customers paying monthly
- Agentic CI/CD pipelines - bugs get detected, fixed, and the customer gets notified, all automatically
- A full consulting delivery system with custom AI agents, automated workflows, and API integrations powering a complete client pipeline
- An NFC smart lock system - hardware and firmware, not just software
- A video production pipeline, cold outreach system, and marketing automation stack

No CS degree. No dev team. No co-founder. Just Claude Code.

This is what the community is built around: shipping SaaS products, automating client delivery, launching new service lines, and replacing expensive software with custom tools you own. All with Claude Code.

Every module, template, and case study inside Claudify comes directly from these production systems. Nothing is theoretical. You are studying real infrastructure that runs real businesses.

**What is Claudify?**

Claudify is where professionals and business owners learn to use Claude Code to do things that were previously out of reach.

Not productivity hacks. Not "automate your email." Real capabilities:

- Run a consulting agency where Claude Code handles the delivery
- Ship a SaaS that generates real revenue
- Offer services you'd normally need an expert or a team to deliver
- Replace SaaS tools that do 80% of what you need with ones that do exactly 100%
- Launch an entire business line from a single subscription

The gap between "I'd need a team for that" and "I did it myself" is closed. The gap between "I'd need an expert" and "I figured it out" is closed. Most people just don't know it yet.

---

**The 21-day milestone.**

Build your first working Claude Code system - a custom agent, a CLAUDE.md-powered workflow, or a slash command that saves you real time - within 21 days. The 21-Day Quick Start gives you a clear, guided path: six modules, weekly coaching calls, and founder check-ins at Day 7 and Day 14. Follow the path, do the work, and you will have a working system by Day 21.

---

**Three tracks (pick the one that fits):**

- **Build for yourself** - Custom tools, internal systems, and workflows that actually fit your business. Stop paying for software that almost works.
- **Build a product** - Ship a SaaS or tool that generates revenue. Follow the exact path behind a $100K/yr product built entirely with Claude Code.
- **Build a service** - Launch a consulting practice or agency powered by Claude Code. Learn how to package, price, and deliver implementation services to clients.

---

**Who is this for?**

- Agency owners who want to launch new service lines without hiring developers
- Consultants who want to deliver 5x more work without 5x more hours
- Business owners paying for SaaS tools that don't quite fit and want to build exactly what they need
- Professionals who see what Claude Code can do and want to go from "that's cool" to "I built that"
- Anyone who has a business idea but thought they needed a technical co-founder or an expensive specialist to make it real

**Who is this NOT for?**

- People looking for income screenshots and get-rich-quick promises. This is a skill community. No income screenshots, no revenue promises.
- Senior developers who already live in the terminal and build with Claude Code daily
- People who watch tutorials but never open a terminal and build something

## Copy Notes (internal, not published)

**v3 changes:**

Fixes applied:
1. Removed "No dev background required" from line 17 - founder pushed back on reassurance framing. The founder's story speaks for itself.
2. Removed "free community" reference from questions section - there is no free tier. Replaced with "DM us directly."
3. Simplified "14 custom AI agents, 23 skills, 5 MCP server integrations" to "custom AI agents, automated workflows, and API integrations" - conveys scale without jargon.
4. Replaced "not an MMO play" with "No income screenshots, no revenue promises" - plain language the audience understands.

KubeCraft patterns applied:
1. **One-line founder story in header** - "Built a $100K/yr SaaS, a self-healing CI/CD pipeline, and a full consulting delivery system with Claude Code. Zero dev background." Sits right below the opening hook.
2. **Proof before features** - "The proof" section now comes before "What do you get?" Founder's portfolio leads, then member outcomes, then deliverables.
3. **Branded deliverable names** - FoundationKit (curriculum), CaseStudyOS (case studies), The Vault (templates), ServiceKit (service playbook). Each feels like a product, not a course module.
4. **Transformation in minimal words** - "From needing a team to being the team." Used in the transformation phrase section and on the landing page.
5. **Timeframe elevated** - "First working system in 21 days" now appears in the header area and the landing page one-liner, not just buried in the guarantee section.

**Patterns from CoderCo (carried over from v2):**
- Year-specific opening line ("in 2026")
- Transformation outcomes before features
- Quantified content library (20+ modules, 5 case studies)
- Annual upsell with tangible bonuses
- Low-risk milestone language near CTA (updated v4: no refund, structured path instead)
- "Have questions?" section
- Specificity throughout

**v4 changes (community plan alignment):**
1. Removed "or your money back" from About section line and landing page one-liner. The 21-day milestone is a structured path, not a refund promise.
2. Rewrote guarantee section: "The 21-day milestone" replaces "The 21-day guarantee." No refund language. Describes the Quick Start path, coaching calls, and founder check-ins.
3. Updated risk reversal line below CTA: "Six modules. Weekly coaching. Founder check-ins. Follow the path." replaces refund language.
4. See `claudify-community-plan.md` for full content structure, launch content, monthly roadmap, onboarding flow, and retention mechanics.

**Still needed:**
- Founder name (to be added to the one-line founder story)
- Testimonials/social proof section once early members produce results
- Final review of branded deliverable names (FoundationKit, CaseStudyOS, The Vault, ServiceKit) - do they feel right or forced?
- Trustpilot or equivalent review platform setup
