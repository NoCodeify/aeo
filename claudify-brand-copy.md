**Full About (expanded, not for Skool character limit)**

The proof.

The founder didn't learn this from a course. He built it:

- DMChamp - a SaaS generating $100K/yr in revenue, with real customers paying monthly
- Agentic CI/CD pipelines - bugs get detected, fixed, and the customer gets notified, all automatically
- A full consulting delivery system with custom AI agents, automated workflows, and API integrations powering a complete client pipeline
- An NFC smart lock system - hardware and firmware, not just software
- A video production pipeline, cold outreach system, and marketing automation stack

No agency. No dev team. No co-founder. Just Claude Code.

This is what the community is built around: shipping SaaS products, automating client delivery, launching new service lines, and replacing expensive software with custom tools you own. All with Claude Code.

Every module, template, and case study inside Claudify comes directly from these production systems. Nothing is theoretical. You are studying real infrastructure that runs real businesses.

Every month you spend paying for SaaS that almost works, or outsourcing work you could do yourself, is money and time you don't get back. The gap between "I'd need a team for that" and "I did it myself" is already closed. Most people just don't know it yet.

What is Claudify?

Claudify is where professionals and business owners learn to use Claude Code to do things that were previously out of reach.

Not productivity hacks. Not "automate your email." Real capabilities:

- Run a consulting agency where Claude Code handles the delivery
- Ship a SaaS that generates real revenue
- Offer services you'd normally need an expert or a team to deliver
- Replace SaaS tools that do 80% of what you need with ones that do exactly 100%
- Launch an entire business line from a single subscription

What do you get? ($97/mo)

Foundations - The full curriculum from first session to multi-agent teams, MCP servers, hooks, and advanced patterns. 20+ modules covering everything from setup to orchestrating AI agent teams.

Case Studies - 5 real-world breakdowns from production systems the founder built and runs. Not walkthroughs of demo apps. Full dissections of a $100K SaaS, an agentic CI/CD pipeline, a consulting delivery system, a hardware project, and an outreach stack.

Service Track - A complete playbook for packaging and selling Claude Code implementation services at $2-5K per project. Scoping, pricing, delivery, client management.

The Build Lab - Every Thursday: hot seats, CLAUDE.md roasts, project teardowns, and live building. Bring your project, share your screen, get unstuck. Rotating format keeps it fresh: hot seats one week, the founder tearing apart your CLAUDE.md the next, then a member demoing their build for a full critique.

Friday Ship Log - Every Friday the founder shares what he built that week with Claude Code. Members reply with their own. A weekly rhythm of building and shipping.

Annual members unlock:

- **The Vault** - Production-grade templates pulled from real businesses. CLAUDE.md files, agent configs, skill setups, project structures. Copy them, adapt them, ship with them. This is the shortcut: ready-to-use production files that save weeks of setup
- 1-on-1 project review with the founder
- Priority access on Build Lab calls
- 2 months free (12 months for the price of 10)

The 21-day milestone.

Build your first working Claude Code system - a custom agent, a CLAUDE.md-powered workflow, or a slash command that saves you real time - within 21 days. The 21-Day Quick Start gives you a clear, guided path: six modules with day-by-day milestones, weekly Build Lab calls, and founder check-ins at Day 7 and Day 14. Follow the path, do the work, and you will have a working system by Day 21.

Three tracks (pick the one that fits):

- Build for yourself - Custom tools, internal systems, and workflows that actually fit your business. Stop paying for software that almost works.
- Build a product - Ship a SaaS or tool that generates revenue. Follow the exact path behind a $100K/yr product built entirely with Claude Code.
- Build a service - Launch a consulting practice or agency powered by Claude Code. Learn how to package, price, and deliver implementation services to clients.

Who is this for?

- Agency owners who want to launch new service lines without hiring developers
- Consultants who want to deliver 5x more work without 5x more hours
- Business owners paying for SaaS tools that don't quite fit and want to build exactly what they need
- Professionals who see what Claude Code can do and want to go from "that's cool" to "I built that"
- Anyone who has a business idea but thought they needed a technical co-founder or an expensive specialist to make it real

Who is this NOT for?

- People looking for income screenshots and get-rich-quick promises. This is a skill community. No income screenshots, no revenue promises.
- Senior developers who already live in the terminal and build with Claude Code daily
- People who watch tutorials but never open a terminal and build something

Common questions:

**"What if I'm not technical?"**
You don't need to be. The Quick Start assumes zero Claude Code experience. You start at "install Claude Code" and build from there. The day-by-day pacing means you're never guessing what to do next.

**"What if I don't have time?"**
30-60 minutes per day. The 21-Day Quick Start is designed around busy professionals. Each day has one action and one community touchpoint. You can do more, but you don't need to.

**"What if it doesn't work for my business?"**
The three tracks cover internal tools, products, and services. If you run a business, one of these tracks applies. The Build Lab gives you live access to the founder to work through your specific use case.

## Copy Notes (internal, not published)

**v5 changes:**

1. **The Vault is now annual-exclusive.** Moved from "What you get ($97/mo)" to annual perks section. Monthly members get Classroom + community + Build Lab + Service Track. Annual members add The Vault + 1-on-1 review + priority coaching + 2 months free. Genuine value gap: monthly members learn everything, annual members get the shortcuts.
2. **Added cost of waiting / opportunity cost framing.** "Every month you spend paying for SaaS that almost works, or outsourcing work you could do yourself, is money and time you don't get back." Added to Full About section and Landing Page body. Inspired by KubeCraft.
3. **Added objection handling section.** Three questions: "What if I'm not technical?", "What if I don't have time?", "What if it doesn't work for my business?" Added after "Who is this NOT for?" section. Inspired by KubeCraft.
4. **Added price lock messaging.** "The price you join at today is yours for life." Added to About section, below main CTA on landing page, and risk reversal section. Inspired by Nate Herk.
5. **Renamed coaching call to "The Build Lab."** All "weekly live coaching" references updated. The Build Lab is now a named, signature community event with rotating formats (hot seats, CLAUDE.md roasts, project teardowns).
6. **Added The Build Lab description.** "Every Thursday: hot seats, CLAUDE.md roasts, project teardowns, and live building. Bring your project, share your screen, get unstuck." Shows the rotating format.
7. **Added Friday Ship Log.** Named the Friday founder update. Members encouraged to reply with their own ship logs. Creates weekly building rhythm.
8. **Updated 21-day milestone.** Now references "day-by-day milestones" (not just six modules). Build Lab replaces "weekly coaching." Consistent with updated community plan.

**Previous versions:**

v4 changes:
1. Removed "or your money back" from About section line and landing page one-liner. The 21-day milestone is a structured path, not a refund promise.
2. Rewrote guarantee section: "The 21-day milestone" replaces "The 21-day guarantee." No refund language.
3. Updated risk reversal line below CTA.

v3 changes:
1. Removed "No dev background required" from line 17 - founder pushed back on reassurance framing.
2. Removed "free community" reference - there is no free tier.
3. Simplified agent/skill counts to plain language.
4. Replaced "not an MMO play" with "No income screenshots, no revenue promises."

KubeCraft patterns applied (v3):
1. One-line founder story in header.
2. Proof before features.
3. Plain deliverable names (Foundations, Case Studies, The Vault, Service Track).
4. Transformation in minimal words.
5. Timeframe elevated to header.

CoderCo patterns applied (v2):
- Year-specific opening line ("in 2026")
- Transformation outcomes before features
- Quantified content library (20+ modules, 5 case studies)
- Annual upsell with tangible bonuses
- Low-risk milestone language near CTA
- "Have questions?" section
- Specificity throughout

**Still needed:**
- Founder name (to be added to the one-line founder story)
- Testimonials/social proof section once early members produce results
- Final review of "The Vault" as a name - the rest are plain labels now
- Trustpilot or equivalent review platform setup
