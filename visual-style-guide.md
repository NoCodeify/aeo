# AEO Visual Style Guide

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** January 2026
**Target Audience:** 30+ year old business owners

---

## Brand Philosophy

Our visuals communicate **expertise and sophistication** to business owners who:
- Value their time and want information fast
- Expect professional, premium quality
- Are skeptical of gimmicks and trends
- Make decisions based on credibility

**We are:** Trusted advisor, strategic partner, premium service
**We are NOT:** Trendy agency, playful startup, budget option

---

## Visual Style: Premium Minimal

The aesthetic is **luxury automotive meets business consulting**.

### Reference Points

**Think:**
- Porsche or BMW brand advertising
- Apple keynote presentation slides
- McKinsey or BCG strategy decks
- Bloomberg or Financial Times data graphics
- Premium lifestyle magazine layouts

**NOT:**
- Pixel art or retro gaming aesthetics
- Hand-drawn Excalidraw sketches
- Blueprint grids or technical schematics
- Cartoon or illustrated styles
- Stock photo collages
- Clip art or template graphics

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Clean Backgrounds
- Solid colors or subtle gradients only
- NO grids, textures, patterns, or noise
- Dark backgrounds for most content
- Let elements breathe with negative space

### 2. Sophisticated Elements
- Clean vector silhouettes and icons
- Subtle detail, not excessive
- Recognizable shapes without clutter
- Consistent treatment across elements

### 3. Warm Gold Accents
- Used sparingly for emphasis
- Guides the eye through the composition
- Creates visual hierarchy
- Conveys premium quality

### 4. Generous Negative Space
- Elements should breathe
- Don't fill every corner
- White space = premium
- Let the important things stand out

### 5. Subtle Depth
- Soft drop shadows (not harsh)
- Gentle glows for emphasis
- Slight gradients for dimension
- Never 3D or photorealistic

## Primary Color Palette

### Backgrounds

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| Deep Navy (top) | #1e2432 | Primary dark background |
| Darker Navy (bottom) | #171c26 | Gradient bottom / deeper dark |
| Charcoal | #1a1a2e | Alternative dark background |

### Primary Elements

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| Soft Silver-White | #e8eaed | Main silhouettes, icons, primary content |
| Cool Gray | #c5c8cc | Secondary details, window tints, subtle elements |
| Medium Gray | #b8bcc2 | Tertiary elements, wheels, minor details |

### Accent

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| Warm Gold | #c9a86c | Arrows, emphasis, focal points, highlights |
| Gold Glow | #c9a86c at 8-12% | Subtle glow behind focal elements |

### Shadows

---

## Text in Images

Imagen 3 (Nano Bana Pro) handles text generation well. Use text when it adds clarity.

### When to Include Text

| Include | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Labels that identify elements | "320i GT", "650i", "Z4" |
| Numbers/data points | "$5M", "$10M", "99%" |
| Comparison labels | "VS", "10 Results", "1 Answer" |
| Position indicators | "1", "2", "3" on podiums |
| Key terms being introduced | "AEO" |

### When to Skip Text

| Skip | Why |
|------|-----|
| Long sentences | Hard to generate accurately |
| Body copy | Too much to read in B-roll |
| Anything you might change | Flexibility in editing |

### Text Styling

- **Font style:** Clean sans-serif (prompt: "clean modern sans-serif typography")
- **Primary text color:** Soft silver-white (#e8eaed)
- **Accent text color:** Warm gold (#c9a86c) for emphasis
- **Weight:** Medium weight, not too bold
- **Size:** Large enough to read at a glance in video
- **Position:** Generous padding, never crowded

---

## Typography in Graphics

When text is added in video editing (never baked into generated images):

### Primary Font Style
- Clean sans-serif (SF Pro, Helvetica Neue, Inter, or similar)
- Medium to regular weight for body
- Light weight for large display text
- No decorative or script fonts

### Text Colors
- Primary text: Soft Silver-White (#e8eaed)
- Accent text: Warm Gold (#c9a86c)
- Never use pure white or bright colors

---

## Image Prompt Structure

### Required Sections

```

## Visual Categories

### Timeline/Progression
- Horizontal left-to-right flow

- Gold accent on preferred side

### Data Visualization
- Minimal chart styles
- No gridlines or axis labels (add in editing)
- Single accent color for data
- Growth shown through simple curves/bars

### Concept Illustration

---

## Application by Context

### YouTube B-Roll
- 1920x1080px (16:9)
- 3-5 seconds on screen typically
- Must read instantly at a glance
- Text added in video editing, not in image
- Support what's being said, don't distract

### Website Graphics
- Various sizes per placement
- Can be more detailed than video B-roll
- May include integrated text
- Should match site's existing aesthetic
- Reference FueGenix style for medical/premium

### Social Media
- Platform-specific dimensions
- Simpler compositions for small screens
- Bold elements that read at thumbnail size
- Consistent with overall brand

---

## Quality Standards

### Always Include
- Exact hex color codes
- Specific element descriptions
- Mood/feeling guidance
- Comprehensive avoid list
- Correct dimensions

### Never Include
- Text baked into generated images (add in editing)
- Brand logos or trademarks
- Photorealistic human faces
- Copyrighted material
- Vague or generic descriptions

### Technical Requirements
- Clean vector-style rendering
- Crisp edges on all elements
- Smooth gradients (no banding)
- Balanced, breathable compositions
- Professional finish

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Do This Instead |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Blueprint grid background | Too technical, busy | Clean solid gradient |
| Pixel art style | Too playful, gaming aesthetic | Clean vector silhouettes |
| Excalidraw/sketch style | Too casual for business audience | Polished, precise elements |
| Pure white elements | Too harsh, not premium | Soft silver-white (#e8eaed) |
| Multiple bright colors | Cluttered, not sophisticated | Single gold accent |
| Busy compositions | Overwhelming, unprofessional | Generous negative space |
| Generic descriptions | Poor generation results | Specific, detailed prompts |
| Short prompts | Inconsistent outputs | 500-1500 words minimum |

## Example: High-Quality Prompt

This demonstrates the expected level of detail:

```
Elegant minimal timeline illustration showing a three-stage car ownership
journey, presented as a sophisticated horizontal progression from left to
right against a clean dark background. The sequence shows: BMW 320i Gran
Turismo → BMW 650i E64 Convertible → BMW Z4 Roadster → ? (unknown next car).

BACKGROUND:
Solid deep navy-charcoal gradient (#1e2432 at top transitioning subtly to
#171c26 at bottom). NO grid lines, NO texture, NO patterns. The background
should be completely clean and uncluttered, allowing the car silhouettes to
be the sole focus. This solid dark backdrop creates a premium, automotive
showroom feeling - like a luxury car advertisement or high-end brand
presentation. The slight gradient adds depth without distraction.

COMPOSITION:
Horizontal layout occupying the middle horizontal band of the frame. The
three car silhouettes should be arranged left to right with generous, equal
spacing between them - approximately 20-25% of the total frame width between
each vehicle. All cars sit on the same invisible baseline, roughly centered
vertically in the frame but perhaps slightly above true center (around 45%
from top) to create a grounded, stable composition. The entire arrangement
should feel balanced and breathable - premium brands use negative space
liberally.
