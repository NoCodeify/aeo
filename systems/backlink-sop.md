- [ ] Relevant to client's niche
- [ ] DR 40+ (ideally 50+)
- [ ] No "sponsored" or nofollow (unless major site)
- [ ] Natural context (not forced)

### What to Avoid

- PBN (Private Blog Network) links
- Link farms or directories with no traffic
- Sites with only outbound links
- Unrelated niches (casino links for healthcare)
- Sites flagged as spam by Google
- Paid links marked as editorial

### Bing Index Check

For ChatGPT visibility, verify site is in Bing:
1. Go to Bing.com
2. Search: `site:[domain.com]`
3. If no results, site isn't indexed in Bing
4. ChatGPT won't see links from that site
