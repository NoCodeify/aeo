## About

```
Hi, I'm Sohaib.

ChatGPT convinced me to buy a Porsche instead of a BMW. A 50K purchase, completely redirected by AI.

That's when I realised: if AI can change MY buying decision, it's changing your customers' decisions too.

I spent 3 years scaling FueGenix from $0 to $20M. First $5M through Meta ads. Scaled to $20M through AI.

In 2025 I cracked how to make brands become the answer when someone asks ChatGPT or Gemini for a recommendation.

Now I help premium brands go from invisible to recommended in 30 days.

All you need is a brand worth recommending and a website.

I built the AEO Protocol in 2025. First case study:

1) FueGenix went from 0/10 Gemini mentions to 7/10 in 30 days. Now #1 globally for "artistic perfection"

2) ChatGPT went from citing wrong pricing ($25K) to accurate ($50K) with direct website citations

3) Brand went from locally invisible to globally recommended for high-net-worth clients

[Add next client results here as you get them]

Google shows 10 results. ChatGPT gives 1 answer.

If you're not that answer, you don't exist.

## Banner Image Prompt (Imagen / Nano Bana)

```
A wide LinkedIn banner image. Dark background with bold white text in the center and a simple upward-trending area chart on the left side. Clean and minimal like a premium consulting brand.

BACKGROUND:
Solid dark color (#0a0a0f) filling the entire frame. Completely clean. No patterns, no textures, no grids, no gradients. Just a flat, dark, near-black background.

DIMENSIONS:
Wide banner format, 4:1 aspect ratio (like 1584x396 pixels). Everything must fit comfortably within this wide, narrow horizontal strip with padding on all sides. Nothing should be cut off or touch the edges.

COMPOSITION:
Two elements only:
1. LEFT SIDE (occupying roughly 15-30% of the width): A simple area chart
2. CENTER-RIGHT (occupying roughly 40-70% of the width): Text block with URL below it

The layout is spacious. Generous empty space on all sides. Nothing crowded. Nothing touching the edges of the frame.

LEFT SIDE - AREA CHART:
A simple, clean upward-trending filled area chart. Like a stock chart or analytics dashboard showing growth.

Specifications:
- The chart sits fully within the left portion of the banner. It does NOT get cut off by the edges. There is clear padding between the chart and the left/bottom/top edges of the frame.
- The chart starts low on the left (near the bottom-left area) and curves upward to the right in a smooth hockey-stick growth shape.
- The top edge of the chart is a smooth curved line in cyan (#00d4ff).
- Below the line, the area is filled with a solid cyan (#00d4ff) at about 20-30% opacity, creating a translucent filled region.
- The chart is simple and iconic. No axis lines. No grid. No data points. No labels. Just the filled shape.
- The chart should be roughly 250-300px wide and 200-250px tall relative to the banner height, sitting in the left quarter of the frame.
- A very subtle soft glow around the top edge of the chart line, cyan at 15% opacity.

CENTER-RIGHT - TEXT:
Three lines of bold text, left-aligned or center-aligned, positioned in the center-right of the banner.

Line 1: "Premium Brands:"
- Bold geometric sans-serif font (like Syne), weight 800
- White color (#f8fafc)
- Large size, roughly 44px relative to banner height

Line 2: "Become The Brand"
- Same font, weight 700
- White color (#f8fafc)
- Same size as line 1

Line 3: "ChatGPT Recommends"
- Same font, weight 700
- Cyan color (#00d4ff) - solid cyan, NOT a gradient
- Same size as lines 1 and 2

Below the text, with a small gap:

A small downward-pointing arrow in cyan (#00d4ff).

Below the arrow:

A rounded pill-shaped outlined box containing "aeoprotocol.ai" in white text. The pill has a thin cyan (#00d4ff) border and the inside is nearly transparent (just barely tinted). A small globe icon sits to the left of the text inside the pill. The text inside the pill is a clean sans-serif font (like Space Grotesk), smaller than the headline text, around 18-20px.

NOTHING ELSE:
There is NO right-side visual element. No orbs. No neural networks. No abstract shapes. No icons. No decorative elements. Just the chart on the left and the text on the right. The empty dark space IS the design. Negative space is intentional.

FOCAL POINT:
The text is the hero. The chart is secondary atmosphere. The eye goes to the text first, then notices the chart supporting it.

MOOD:
- Clean, confident, premium, minimal
- Like a high-end consulting firm's website header
- Think: McKinsey slide, Apple keynote title card, Stripe homepage
- NOT: Busy, techy, sci-fi, futuristic, cyberpunk
- NOT: Abstract blobs, orbs, neural networks, nodes, connections
- NOT: Cluttered, decorative, or illustrative

COLOR SUMMARY:
- Background: #0a0a0f (near-black, solid, flat)
- Chart fill: #00d4ff at 20-30% opacity
- Chart line: #00d4ff at 100% opacity
- Chart glow: #00d4ff at 15% opacity
- Headline text: #f8fafc (white)
- "ChatGPT Recommends" text: #00d4ff (cyan)
- Pill border: #00d4ff at 50% opacity
- Pill text: #f8fafc (white)
- Arrow: #00d4ff (cyan)

TEXT LABELS:
- "Premium Brands:" — bold geometric sans-serif, white, large
- "Become The Brand" — bold geometric sans-serif, white, large
- "ChatGPT Recommends" — bold geometric sans-serif, cyan (#00d4ff), large
- "aeoprotocol.ai" — clean sans-serif, white, small, inside pill outline

AVOID:
- Any abstract shapes, orbs, blobs, or spheres
- Neural networks, nodes, connection lines
- Gradients on the background
- Any element on the right side of the banner
- Patterns, textures, grids, dots on background
- Photographs or photorealistic elements
- People, faces, hands, objects
- 3D effects, perspective, isometric views
- Neon glow, cyberpunk, sci-fi aesthetics
- Any element being cut off by the frame edges
- Busy or cluttered composition
- More than 2 colors (just white and cyan on dark)
- The chart touching or bleeding off the edges
- Any decorative borders
- Cartoon or illustration style
- Stock photo feeling
- Pure white (#ffffff) background areas
- Any logos or brand marks
- Pixel measurements in the rendered text (like "8px")
```

## Notes

- As you get AEO clients, replace the placeholder lines in the About section with named testimonial results in the same format as FueGenix (e.g. "[Name] went from X to Y in Z days")
- Ty uses 5 named client results. Once you have 3+, this section becomes the strongest part of the bio.
- The "Started in 2024. Mastered by 2025." mirrors Ty's origin timeline.
- The mechanism (AEO Protocol) is positioned as an identity/branded system, not explained in detail.
- Process details (10-run test, first 50 words) are saved for content/sales calls, not the bio.
- Banner colors match aeoprotocol.ai landing page exactly (cyan #00d4ff, dark #0a0a0f, purple #8b5cf6)
