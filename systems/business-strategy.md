# AEO Business Strategy - Full Research Synthesis

**Date:** February 5, 2026
**Status:** Research complete, ready for decision

---

## THE DECISION

Based on deep research across 5 parallel agents, the strategy is:

**AEO white-label SaaS + Skool community for agencies, sold via YouTube. LinkedIn for direct B2B to business owners.**

---

## POSITIONING: AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)

AEO is a category term like SEO - nobody owns it. Kasim Aslam has AEO.co but that's like having SEO.com - doesn't stop thousands of SEO businesses. Use AEO freely.

- **AEO** is the emerging industry term (+900% YoY search growth)
- Other players exist (Kasim Aslam, Nico Gorrono, Ethan Smith) but NONE own YouTube
- Category is big enough for multiple players, just like SEO has thousands of agencies/tools
- Can also use "AI Visibility" and "AI Search Optimization" interchangeably for broader reach

---

## THE MARKET GAP

### YouTube: WIDE OPEN
- NO dominant YouTube creator consistently publishing weekly AI visibility/AEO content
- Thought leaders (Ethan Smith/Graphite, Kevin Indig, Kasim Aslam) distribute via podcasts/newsletters, NOT YouTube
- "Rank in ChatGPT" on YouTube = essentially empty
- "I tested 100 brands in ChatGPT" format = nobody doing this
- Targeting EXISTING agencies (not beginners) = underserved

### Skool: NEARLY EMPTY
- Kasim's AEO community: only 105 members
- No other Skool community focused on AI visibility/GEO
- Liam's 290K community is general AI automation - too broad for AEO-specific learning

### SaaS: THE EMPTY QUADRANT (Updated Feb 7 with Instagram ad research)
| | Cheap ($49-299) | Expensive ($500+) |
|---|---|---|
| **Tracking only** | Otterly, Nimt.ai ($79-179), LLMrefs, Ahrefs | Peec, Profound, PromptWatch |
| **Content autopilot** | AutoSEO (~$99), RankPill ($99), BabyLoveGrowth (GBP99) | GrackerAI ($2K+) |
| **Tracking + Implementation** | **MentionedIn.ai ($49-299)** | AEO Engine ($797+) |

> **14 competitors found via Instagram ads** (Feb 7, 2026). Full analysis: `systems/instagram-competitor-analysis.md`

## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### VC-Funded AEO Tools ($200M+ total funding)
- Profound: $58.5M (Sequoia), $499/mo+
- Peec AI: $29M, $4M+ ARR
- Bluefish: $24M, $299/mo+
- Scrunch: $19M, $100-500/mo
- Evertune: $15M, ecommerce focus

### SEO Tools Adding AEO
- Semrush: $99/mo add-on
- Ahrefs: Brand Radar (free)
- SE Ranking, Surfer SEO, Moz: all adding features

### Bootstrapped
- Otterly.ai: 15K+ users, $29-489/mo (tracking only, no white-label)
- AEO Engine: $70K MRR, agency-in-a-box ($797-2.4K/mo)
- GrackerAI: $2K-9.5K/mo, auto-content generation

### Instagram Ad Competitors (Feb 7, 2026 — 14 companies actively running IG ads)

**AI Visibility Trackers (Direct):**
- Nimt.ai: $79-179/mo, pure AI visibility tracking across ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude/Perplexity. No white-label, no implementation.
- Briljant.nl: EUR39-99/mo, Dutch GEO platform. White-label but Dutch market only. Technical tools (SSR scan, LLMs.txt generator).
- PromptWatch: Enterprise pricing (hidden), 880M+ citations analyzed. 9 AI engines. Agency white-label.
- AnswerRank: Unknown (JS-blocked). Name implies direct competitor.

**Content Autopilots (Indirect):**
- AutoSEO: ~$99/mo, 30 articles/mo + backlinks. "Agency-quality SEO without $5K bill." No white-label.
- RankPill: $99/mo, 30 articles/mo, auto-publish. "Fire your $3K/mo agency." No white-label.
- BabyLoveGrowth: GBP99/mo, articles + backlinks + LLM tracking. Agency white-label plan.
- Outrank: Unknown pricing, SEO content automation. No AI search focus.

**Traditional SEO (Tangential):**
- HikeSEO: $90-749/mo, AI agent "Kit" for small agencies. Extensive white-label. Traditional SEO not AEO.
- Climbo: $1,497-2,997 lifetime, review management + GEO bolt-on. Full white-label.
- Soogle: $67/mo, automated backlinks. Mentions ChatGPT in positioning.

### NONE of them combine: affordable + white-label + implementation playbooks + consistency testing + "business in a box"

## 6 AGENCY PAIN POINTS (FROM REDDIT, FORUMS, REVIEWS)

1. **Measurement is broken** - No way to prove ROI, tools show conflicting data, 40-60% monthly citation drift
2. **No standard methodology** - No "SEO playbook" equivalent for AEO, agencies improvising
3. **Client reporting is a nightmare** - Manual screenshots, no white-label, can't justify $5K retainers
4. **Multi-client management doesn't exist** - Tools built for in-house, not agencies with 20+ clients
5. **Monitoring only, no action** - Every tool says "you score 3/10" but none say HOW to fix it
6. **Stakeholder buy-in is difficult** - CMOs want ROI, AEO delivers indirect long-term benefits

---

## 5 PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATORS (THINGS NO COMPETITOR DOES)

### 1. Audit-to-Playbook Engine
Auto-generate URL-specific playbook: "Rewrite homepage first 50 words to include [entity], [price], [location]. Add FAQ schema with these 5 questions." Every audit produces a click-by-click implementation plan.

### 2. 10-Run Statistical Consistency Testing
Run each query 10x per LLM. Report mention rate (7/10 = 70%), position variance, sentiment distribution. Every competitor runs 1x. Agencies can show "you went from 30% to 80% mention rate."

### 3. Affordable White-Label ($149-299 per org (15-50 clients))
Branded client dashboard (agency logo, custom domain). Otterly has no white-label. Nimt.ai has no white-label. Briljant charges per-site (EUR39-99). HikeSEO charges per-site ($90-749). GrackerAI costs $2K+. MentionedIn.ai charges per-org (with client seat limits) and includes implementation.

### 4. First 50 Words Technical Audit
Automated check: does every key page have WHO/WHAT/WHERE/PRICE in first 50 words? Plus robots.txt AI crawler check, SSR/SSG verification, schema markup, llms.txt. Zero competitors do this.

### 5. Battle Cards Per Missing Query
When audit finds brand NOT mentioned for a query, generate a "Battle Card": exactly what content to create, entities to include, sources to get cited in, technical changes needed.

## YOUTUBE CONTENT STRATEGY

### The Samin Yasar Lesson (Data-Backed)
Samin's niche BookedIn content got 150-700 views. His broader Claude/AI trending content
got 46K-157K views (200-1000x more). He hit RECORD REVENUE the same month.

Lesson: Broad trending content grows the channel. Niche content converts. You need both.
But your AEO keywords ("ai seo" 10K-100K/mo, "google ai overviews" 10K-100K/mo) are
actually bigger than Samin's niche terms, so search-targeted content is more viable for you.

### Three Content Pillars

**Pillar 1: Trending AI + Your Angle (40% of videos)**
- Ride every AI wave with YOUR search/marketing lens
- New Claude feature → "Claude Just Changed SEO Forever"
- New Gemini update → "Gemini's New Feature Changes How Brands Get Found"
- AI news → first to cover with data
- Expected views: 10K-100K+ (algorithm-driven spikes)
- Purpose: Channel growth, subscriber acquisition

**Pillar 2: Search-Targeted Keyword Content (40% of videos)**
- Target keywords from aeo-keyword-data.md
- These rank in YouTube search + Google, bring consistent traffic forever
- Expected views: 1K-10K (consistent, evergreen)
- Purpose: Authority, searchable library, steady growth

Target keywords (from keyword data file):
| Keyword | Volume | Video Title |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| ai seo | 10K-100K | "AI SEO: The Complete Guide for 2026" |
| google ai overviews | 10K-100K | "Google AI Overviews: How to Get Featured" |
| answer engine optimization | 1K-10K (+900%) | "Answer Engine Optimization: What You Need to Know" |
| seo vs geo | 1K-10K (+900%) | "SEO vs GEO: What Actually Matters in 2026" |
| is seo dead | 1K-10K | "Is SEO Dead? I Tested It With Real Data." |
| ai search optimization | 1K-10K (+9,900%) | "AI Search Optimization: Get Found by ChatGPT & Gemini" |
| rank in chatgpt | 10-100 (+inf) | "How to Rank in ChatGPT (Step-by-Step)" |
| how to optimize for ai search | 100-1K | "How to Optimize for AI Search (Complete Tutorial)" |

**Pillar 3: Niche Agency/Conversion Content (20% of videos)**
- Directly targets agencies and potential SaaS/Skool customers
- Expected views: 500-2K (low but high conversion)
- Purpose: Skool signups, SaaS conversions

Examples:
- "I Tested 100 Brands in ChatGPT - Most Are Invisible"
- "How to Sell AEO Services to Your Existing Clients"
- "Add AEO to Your Agency ($3K/mo Revenue Stream)"
- "The First 50 Words Rule That Gets You Into ChatGPT"
- Live audit demos, tool walkthroughs

### First 8 Videos (Mix of All 3 Pillars)
| # | Title | Pillar | Expected Views |
|---|-------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | "I Tested 100 Brands in ChatGPT - Shocking Results" | Trending + data | 10K-50K |
| 2 | "AI SEO: The Complete Guide for 2026" | Search (10K-100K vol) | 5K-20K |
| 3 | [Trending AI topic of the week] + your angle | Trending | 10K-100K+ |
| 4 | "SEO vs GEO: What Actually Matters in 2026" | Search (1K-10K vol) | 2K-10K |
| 5 | [Next trending AI topic] + your angle | Trending | 10K-100K+ |
| 6 | "Is SEO Dead? I Tested It With Real Data" | Search (1K-10K vol) | 2K-10K |
| 7 | "How to Sell AEO Services to Clients" | Niche/conversion | 500-2K |
| 8 | "Google AI Overviews: How to Get Featured" | Search (10K-100K vol) | 5K-20K |

### Content Differentiation
- Every video uses REAL audit data from the MCP tools
- Run audits LIVE on camera
- Show actual ChatGPT/Gemini responses
- Data-driven ("I tested X brands" format)
- Cover trending AI through a search/marketing lens (unique angle)
- NOT motivational/hustle content
- NOT "how to start an AI agency" (saturated)

### CTA on Every Video
- "Join the free AEO community" (Skool link)
- "Get the free audit template" (lead magnet)
- Brand is always associated with AEO/AI visibility regardless of video topic

---

## LINKEDIN CONTENT STRATEGY

### Target: Business Owners (NOT marketers)

### Post Types
| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Wake-up call | Screenshot post | "I asked ChatGPT for the best [X] in [city]. Your competitor showed up." |
| Data insight | Carousel (6.6% engagement) | "I audited 50 brands. 73% are invisible to AI." |
| Case study | Text post | "Client went from 0 mentions to #1 in 6 weeks." |
| Demo | Short video | Screen recording of ChatGPT search |
| Newsletter | Monthly | "AI Visibility Report" - audit 5 brands in an industry |

### Outreach Strategy
1. View profile + engage with posts (3-5 days)
2. Connect (no pitch): "Following your journey in [space]."
3. Value-first DM: "I ran a quick check on [company]'s AI visibility. You're not showing up in ChatGPT for [query]. Your competitor [X] is. Want the breakdown?"
4. Follow-up with Loom (30-60 sec) showing the audit
5. CTA: 15-min call

### Frequency: 3-5 posts/week, carousels + short video preferred

## KEY RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Kasim Aslam owns "AEO" branding | Use "AI Visibility" positioning instead |
| AEO gets absorbed into SEO tools | Focus on implementation layer, not monitoring |
| Market too early | Keyword data shows +900% YoY growth, timing is right |
| YouTube too slow to grow | LinkedIn provides immediate lead gen while channel builds |
| SaaS too complex to build | Start with web reports (shareable links), add PDF later |
| Measurement problem unsolved | 10-run consistency testing is more rigorous than competitors |

---

## INSPIRATION MODELS

| Creator | What to Learn |
|---------|--------------|
| Samin Yasar (BookedIn) | Teach method + sell tool. 15K subs = $60K MRR |
| Albert Olgaard (BuildMyAgent) | Triple-layer Skool (free + paid + SaaS). Plain language for non-technical audience |
| Nick Saraev (Maker School) | Daily Loom videos = sticky community. $184/mo = $400K+/mo |
| ChatDash (Habeen Jun) | Ecosystem partnerships (Voiceflow, Retell AI). Product-led content |
| Justin Welsh | LinkedIn content machine. $10M+ solo. Daily posting cadence |
