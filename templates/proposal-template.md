## What Makes Us Different

### 1. The Protocol
We follow a documented, repeatable methodology specifically designed for AI search optimization. Not generic SEO retrofitted for AEO.

### 2. Consistency Testing
We test every query 10 times across both ChatGPT and Gemini. LLM responses vary - one test tells you nothing about actual visibility.

### 3. Speed
Most agencies take weeks. We deliver audits in 48 hours and content weekly. AI search changes fast; we move faster.

### 4. Transparency
You see exactly what LLMs say about you. Every test, every result, every change tracked and reported.

---

## Proof Points

### Case Study: [Previous Client]
- Starting visibility: [X]%
- After 90 days: [Y]%
- Key achievement: [Specific result]

### Methodology
Our protocol is built on research into how LLMs retrieve and cite sources, including:
- ChatGPT's 3-layer architecture (Bing + cached + synthesized)
- Gemini's Google Search grounding
- Entity establishment patterns
- Citation triggers
