Here are Sohaib's key achievements with the storytelling elements included:

1. Earned his first €100 online through YouTube on September 26, 2012 by posting gaming videos (Counter-Strike)
  * Describes this moment as "wow, this is really possible"
  * Says this is how he "became addicted to entrepreneurship and making money online"
2. "Cracked the code" of YouTube after 1-2 years, achieving massive view counts:
  * 250,000 views in 48 days (shown in screenshot)
  * Record of 2 million views per 48 hours (approximately 1 million views per day)
  * 350,000 views in 48 hours (shown in screenshot)
3. Significant YouTube earnings:
  * Made €1,500 in a single day when he was 16 or 17 years old
  * Earned €30,000 in one month, which prompted his father to call asking "Hey, what are you doing? How is that possible? You earn more in a month than I earn in a year"
  * Was making Excel graphs planning when he could buy his Lamborghini
  * Nearly earned €100,000 ("een ton") in the following month before YouTube shut down his channel
4. E-commerce ventures (2016-2017):
  * First attempted Amazon FBA, investing €5,000 in t-shirts and glasses called "Good Glasses" (which failed)
  * Still has some of the unsold t-shirts, had to destroy the glasses that were sent to Amazon
  * Created a successful dropshipping store called "CryptoClothe" combining the dropshipping trend with crypto trend
  * Generated €15,000 in first month's revenue with Crypto Clothe
  * Sold the CryptoClothe webshop after a few months
  * Started and later sold another webshop selling physical products
5. Early in crypto, Bitcoin was less than 1k
6. Scaled FueGenix from 0-10mil in just 5 years
7. Scaled an agency called Gain Impact to 6-figures and a team of 10, sold his share. Btw the reason I left is conflict of interest. So our biggest client, what they did is they build drink dispenser like a giant container. All kinds of drinks. But then they decided they would just dispense beer. I was like no we cant work tighter anymore but my business partner didnt care. I was gonna get married so couldn’t feed my family with haram money.
8. with SMB360.ai Worked with elite clinics worldwide - from Miami to Dubai. When top clinics want to scale, they come to him.





So why did I start DM Champ.

At SMB360.ai I noticed a troubling pattern across all my clients: Despite delivering floods of leads, they couldn't keep up with inquiries on WhatsApp, Instagram, and website chats. Conversations went cold. Millions in revenue disappeared.

So I made a radical move—dropped all other clients and went all-in as FueGenix's CMO. We built an internal AI solution that could actually handle sales conversations naturally and at scale. The results? We scaled from $3M to $10M in just 3 more years.

Existing AI chatbots were a joke—robotic, clueless, useless for actual sales. That's why I'm now making DM Champ available to everyone. It's the sales tool I built from real-world experience—AI that actually feels human, understands context, handles objections, and consistently converts leads into customers, even for high-ticket items.

Hi, I'm Sohaib!

Thanks for being here. My journey hasn't been linear, but it's been driven by a relentless passion for building cool things online and figuring out how to make them win.

You know that kid obsessed with game makers, trying to build entire worlds? Yeah, that was me. It wasn't just about playing; it was about creating. That led me down the rabbit hole of coding – starting with Notepad++ websites back in high school just for the thrill of it.

Things got serious when I realised you could actually make real money doing this stuff online. September 26, 2012 – I made my first €100 from posting Counter-Strike videos on YouTube. It wasn't much, but it was a lightning bolt moment: "Wow, this is really possible." I was hooked. Addicted to entrepreneurship.

For the next couple of years, I went deep, obsessively cracking the YouTube code. It paid off. At my peak, channels I ran were pulling 2 million views every 48 hours. I remember making €1,500 in a single day as a teenager. Then came the month I banked €30,000. My own dad called me, shocked: "What are you doing? You earn more in a month than I earn in a year!" I was literally mapping out how quickly I could buy a Lamborghini.

Then, reality check: Just as I was about to hit nearly €100k the next month, YouTube pulled the plug. Channel gone. Lamborghini dreams paused. Lesson learned: diversify, adapt, rebuild.

So I did. Dabbled in e-commerce (2016-17). Tried Amazon FBA – invested €5k in "Good Glasses," which bombed spectacularly (still got some of those unsold tees!). Pivoted to dropshipping, caught the crypto wave, and launched "Crypto Clothe" – €15,000 revenue in the first month. Sold that, started another, sold that too. Learned the hustle of finding trends and executing fast. Got into Bitcoin when it was still under $1k.



With a foundation in both creating software and a proven knack for online marketing, I wanted to combine these worlds. That led me to co-found Gain Impact. The vision was ambitious: a hybrid agency that would deliver both cutting-edge software solutions and high-performance marketing campaigns. My co-founder brought deep software expertise, and I brought my full stack of marketing savvy and hands-on software development experience.

In practice, however, it felt like juggling two distinct businesses under one roof. The complexity was immense. While we achieved 6-figure revenues and grew a team of 10, I eventually sold my share, realizing I craved a more singularly focused venture.

Before co-founding Gain Impact, my journey had taken me into the heart of high-growth marketing. I took on the CMO role at FueGenix, my gym partner's own clinic. We started from absolute zero. Over five intense years, I architected and executed the marketing strategies that scaled FueGenix from literally $0 to over $10 million in revenue. It became a model for how to achieve explosive growth in the aesthetics space.

After selling my share in Gain Impact, I launched my own dedicated marketing agency, SMB360.ai. Armed with the proven systems that scaled FueGenix, I started working with other elite clinics worldwide, from Miami to Dubai.

And this is where the a-ha moment for DM Champ truly crystallized.

Time and time again, with SMB360.ai delivering world-class marketing and a flood of high-quality leads to these clinics, I saw the exact same, expensive problem emerge: Lead follow-up was broken.

I watched as over 20 of these clinics, clients of SMB360.ai armed with powerful lead generation, still struggled to scale or even failed. It wasn't the marketing; the leads were golden. It was the human element – the difficulty in consistently, effectively, and personally engaging prospects across WhatsApp, Instagram, and web chat in a timely manner.

Leads went cold. Appointments weren't booked. Millions in potential revenue evaporated. This wasn't just an occasional hiccup; it was a systemic failure point I was witnessing across my own agency's client base.

Seeing this consistent bottleneck, costing businesses dearly, reignited my software developer instincts. The existing AI chatbot solutions were a joke – robotic, easily confused, and utterly incapable of the nuanced, sales-driven conversations needed for high-value prospects.

DM Champ is the direct answer to that critical problem I saw firsthand, over and over, with my own agency clients.

It’s not just another piece of software. It’s built from years in the trenches of digital marketing, scaling businesses, and my deep-seated passion for crafting effective software solutions. It's designed to be the AI sales and support agent that understands context, speaks like your brand, integrates seamlessly, and most importantly, helps businesses stop losing leads and start closing deals.

We're laser-focused on building DM Champ to be the indispensable tool that finally bridges the critical gap between brilliant marketing and a booming bottom line.

We're just getting started. Got feedback? Hit me up: [sohaib@dmchamp.com]. Let's build this.
