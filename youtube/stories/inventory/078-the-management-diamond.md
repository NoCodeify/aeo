**Purpose:** Diagnosing team performance issues  
**When someone isn't performing, check:**
- **WHAT** you want (Clear expectations?)
- **HOW** to do it (Proper training?)
- **WHEN** to do it (Deadlines clear?)
- **WHY** it matters (Purpose understood?)
**Real Example:** Developer missing deadlines - turned out he knew WHAT and HOW, but not WHEN
