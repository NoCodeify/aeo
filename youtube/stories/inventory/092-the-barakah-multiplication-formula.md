**The Formula:** Halal intention + Excellent delivery + Patience through delay = Exponential growth with barakah
**Key Points:**
- Can't fake the intention
- There's always a delay (that's the test)
- Most people don't wait long enough
- Multiplication comes in unexpected ways
**Quote:** "Money without blessing is stress. Wealth with barakah? That's true success"
