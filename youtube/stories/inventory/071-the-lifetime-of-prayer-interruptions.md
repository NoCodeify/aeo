**Context:** Before owning business  
**The Reality:**
- School: Squeezing prayers between classes
- University: Between lectures
- Work: Between meetings
- Always rushing, always apologizing
- Being "that awkward Muslim who has to leave"
**Specific Quotes:**
- "Sorry boss, I need to pray"
- "Sorry professor, can I step out?"
- "Sorry team, be right back"
**Transformation:** Now calendar has prayer times blocked off
**Quote:** "This isn't just convenience - it's dignity"
