**The Formula:** "Are we fully booked? Yes? Raise prices"  
**Timeline:**
- Started at $3,000
- Within a month: Fully booked
- Munib stressed: "We can't handle more patients!"
- Sohaib's response: "Perfect. Let's raise prices to $5,000"
- Munib thought he was crazy
- Result: Got MORE bookings at $5K, not less
- Progression:
  - $3K → $5K → $8K → $12K → $20K → $50K → $75K → $100K
- Sometimes charge even more for complex cases
- Currently: 12-month waitlist at $100K
