**Client Profile:** Agency owner named Nick
**Initial Contact:** Few months ago
**The Problem:**
- Ran marketing agency for restaurants
- Restaurants terrible at asking for reviews
- Reviews crucial for restaurant success
- Customers leave happy but never leave reviews

**The Solution:**
- Use DM Champ for automated follow-up
- Message customers next morning via WhatsApp (or 12 hours after visit)
- Thank them and ask about experience
- If 5 stars → Direct to Yelp or Google review
- If less than 5 stars → Private feedback form
- Completely automated AI conversation

**Results:**
- Agency growth: Getting 1 NEW restaurant customer PER DAY
- "They're getting about one new customer per day for the agency"
- Restaurant results: "Almost guaranteed they get #1 for their region or their area"
- Ranking improvement is "almost guaranteed"
- Within 2 months initially: 5 restaurants signed up
- Charging: €500/month each
- Monthly recurring revenue scaling rapidly
- Restaurant transformation: 5-10 reviews/month → 30-40 reviews/month
- All automated, zero human time required

**The Automation Perception Insight:**
- Owner also sends reservation confirmations via WhatsApp
- Reservation is obviously automated
- When customers receive automated reservation...
- They assume review request is also automated
- "Nobody would respond to the review request anymore"
- Key learning: If ONE message looks automated, ALL messages are assumed AI
- Solution: Keep different message types separated or make ALL human-like

**Quote:** "Nick went from just another marketing agency to offering complete reputation management. They're getting about one new customer per day for the agency and almost all the restaurants, it's almost guaranteed they get that they get a number one for their region or their area."
