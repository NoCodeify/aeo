**The Problem Identified:**
- "We've listened a bit too much to customers"
- "We've built too much"
- "Now we're actually realizing we've built too much"
- "We kind of need to niche down"
- Platform trying to serve everyone

**The Irony:**
- Started with YouTube lesson: "Listen to your market"
- Learned that lesson hard
- Applied it at DM Champ
- But went too far
- "Yeah we're doing that at DM Champ as well"
- "We've listened a bit too much to customers"

**What They Built:**
- WhatsApp (core feature)
- Instagram
- Messenger
- Multiple channels
- Countless feature requests
- Each customer wanted something different

**The Example Use Cases:**
- Database reactivation (core use case)
- Chat widget for websites
- Review collection for restaurants
- Lead nurturing
- Appointment booking
- "That's just one use case that could have been its entire product on its own"
- Each could be standalone SaaS

**The Current State:**
- ~500 users total (mix of active and inactive)
- ~300 from AppSumo (200 after refunds)
- ~€10k MRR
- 15% monthly churn rate
- Customer lifetime: 10 months (1/0.15)
- "That's a big bottleneck at the moment"

**The Churn Analysis:**
- People sign up
- People leave
- "Our churn is about 15%"
- Math: 15% churn = 6.67 month average lifetime
- Reality: Some stay years, many leave quickly
- Average: ~10 months

**The Root Cause:**
- Targeting "literally everybody"
- No clear ideal customer profile
- Too broad to optimize for anyone
- Jack of all trades, master of none
- "We're targeting literally everybody"

**The VC vs Bootstrap Reality:**
- "If you just look at other successful software companies"
- "Only the ones with like massive VC funding can do something like that"
- "Can focus on everyone"
- DM Champ reality: "More bootstrapped than VC"
- Can't afford to serve everyone

**The Strategic Problem:**
- No focus = hard to market
- No focus = hard to optimize product
- No focus = high churn
- No focus = expensive customer acquisition
- Serving everyone = serving no one well

**The Customer Education Gap:**
- "A big part of our customer base"
- "They don't actually have a good idea of how to use it, how to implement it"
- Added chat widget to website
- But: "They don't even have website traffic"
- Complain: "Nobody's starting the chat"
- Response: "It's not our problem that you don't have traffic"

**The Wrong Customers:**
- People without traffic buying chat widgets
- People without databases buying reactivation tools
- Feature requests from people who won't succeed anyway
- Built features for customers who churned anyway

**The Phase They're In:**
- "We're in a moment where we're in a phase"
- "Need to find a bit more focus"
- "Exactly which customer we want to serve"
- Need to choose: What's the core use case?
- Who is the ideal customer?

**What Works (Known):**
- WhatsApp database reactivation
- "People that successfully use DM Champ, they're using it for WhatsApp"
- Restaurant review collection (1 customer/day growth)
- Hair transplant clinic follow-up
- High-ticket service businesses

**The Lesson from YouTube (Coming Full Circle):**
- YouTube: Listened to audience, learned hard lesson
- Early DM Champ: Applied that lesson
- Mid DM Champ: Over-applied it
- Now: Need to balance listening with vision
- "We've listened a bit too much"

**The Correction Needed:**
- Pick one niche
- Pick one core use case
- Optimize everything for that
- Cut features that don't serve it
- Increase focus = decrease churn
- Prove model, then expand

**The Competitive Landscape:**
- Other SaaS companies with focus win
- Vertical SaaS (niche-specific) growing
- Horizontal SaaS needs massive funding
- Can't compete with broad scope on bootstrap budget
- Focus is the bootstrap advantage

**Quote:** "We've listened a bit too much to customers where basically we've listened to everything at this point and now we're actually realizing we've built too much and we kind of need to niche down."

**Current Metrics Show Problem:**
- 15% monthly churn = customer stays ~10 months
- €10k MRR with 500 users = many inactive/low-price
- Need focus to improve unit economics
- Need higher retention to scale profitably
- Can't keep building for everyone

**The Path Forward (Implied):**
- Analyze which customers have lowest churn
- Analyze which use cases have highest success
- Pick ONE to double down on
- Cut or deprioritize everything else
- Increase retention from 10 months to 24+ months
- Then can profitably scale

**For Other Founders:**
- Customer feedback is valuable
- But not all feedback is equal
- Listen to your best customers, not all customers
- Feature requests from churned customers = waste
- Focus beats features
- Especially when bootstrapped
- VC-backed can spray and pray
- Bootstrap must snipe with precision
