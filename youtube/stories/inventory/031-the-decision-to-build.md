**Timeline:** After seeing pattern repeatedly  
**Key Details:**
- Dropped all SMB360 clients except FueGenix
- Went all-in as FueGenix CMO to solve the problem
- Every existing chatbot was terrible:
  - Robotic conversations
  - Easily confused
  - Couldn't handle sales conversations
- Decision: "I'll build our own"
- Advantage: Computer engineering degree, software development skills
- Hired help for specific components
- Quote: "Nothing more satisfying than eating from your own hands' work"
