**Timeline:** During early entrepreneurship phase  
**The Setup:**
- On the way to Islamic lesson with uncle
- Had the Crypto Clothe dropshipping idea
- Set it up after getting home from religious learning
- Posted on Reddit before bed
- Woke up to 10 sales, $250 revenue
**The Irony:** First "real" business success came while pursuing Islamic knowledge
**Quote:** "I was like 'Wooo this is crazy!'"
**Later Realization:** This successful business was actually haram (dropshipping)
**Lesson:** Sometimes Allah teaches through mistakes
