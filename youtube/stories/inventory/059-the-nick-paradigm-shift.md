**The Realization:**
- "I'd been doing this all wrong"
- Thought because he could code, should build from scratch
- While spending years perfecting code, others solving problems
- Nick didn't care who built solution
- Restaurant clients didn't care either
- Just wanted more positive reviews
- Quote: "Engineer ego" getting in the way
