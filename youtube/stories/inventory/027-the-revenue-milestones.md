**5-Year Journey:**
- Year 0: Started from €0 during COVID pandemic
- Year 1: Hit €1 million in revenue
- Year 2-3: Scaled to €3 million revenue
- Year 4: €5 million revenue
- Year 5: Over €10 million (doubled in one year with DM Champ)
- Key insight: Huge growth came from never missing leads with AI

**Additional Context:**
- Started "during COVID" from absolute zero
- "Within a year we already hit 1 million in revenue"
- "Year two or three we scaled it to 3 million"
- "This is pretty high profit margin business"
- High margins allowed aggressive reinvestment
- Growth enabled by systematic marketing and tech improvements
