**The Concept:** "Your rizq is written, but your effort is the key that unlocks it"
**Explanation:**
- Every client meant for you is already chosen
- Every dollar meant for you is already allocated
- But without action, how will your rizq find you?
**Application:** Effort doesn't create rizq, it unlocks pre-written rizq
