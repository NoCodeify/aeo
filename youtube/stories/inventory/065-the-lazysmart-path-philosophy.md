**Core Belief:**
- Nothing wrong with finding efficient path to wealth
- Prophet ﷺ chose easier option when both permissible
- Smart people evaluate opportunities for best ROI
- "Get-rich-quicker" and "get-rich-easier" exist
- Work smarter, not harder
- Success about what boat you're in, not how hard you row
