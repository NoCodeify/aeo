**The Background:**
- "A few years ago I also had a software agency"
- Actually: "software marketing agency"
- Did both software development and marketing
- Built solutions for other companies
- Had multiple developers on team

**The Team:**
- Employed "a good few developers"
- Agency eventually ended (around beer client crisis/partner exit)
- Team dispersed
- Relationships maintained

**The Reconnection:**
- Former colleague reached out
- Asked if there were any opportunities
- This was during early DM Champ development phase
- Only Sohaib was coding at that point

**The Hire:**
- "Sure, you can start working on this"
- Former employee became first DM Champ developer
- Already knew working style and standards
- Had existing trust and relationship
- No onboarding friction

**The Team Evolution:**
- Started: Just Sohaib coding
- First hire: This former colleague
- Worked together for "a few months"
- Started looking for more developers
- "Hired a lot, let go of most because they weren't good enough"
- Eventually found one more who is "really good"
- Current team: 3 developers total

**What Makes a Bad Developer (in 2024/2025):**
- "Can you imagine not knowing how to use AI in this age?"
- Had people who "didn't know how to use AI"
- Had people who "didn't want to use AI"
- "Just doesn't make sense" to not use AI tools
- This was a disqualifier for new hires

**Current Team Status:**
- Original colleague: "He's still working on the product"
- Second good developer: Still on team
- Team of 3 total: Stable and effective
- Product mostly done: "Kind of done but at the same time it's never done"

**The Broader Pattern:**
- Built agency, gained experience
- Trained developers
- Agency ended, maintained relationships
- Those relationships became founding team for next venture
- Example of long-term relationship value

**Quote:** "I had a old colleague of me that worked for me. So a few years ago I also had a software agency... one of those developers reached out to me, asked if I have any opportunities for him and I said sure, you can start working on this."

**Hiring Philosophy Today:**
- Quality over quantity ("hired a lot, let go of most")
- Must embrace AI ("didn't know how to use AI" = disqualified)
- Relationships matter more than resume
- Former colleagues who already know your standards = ideal hires
