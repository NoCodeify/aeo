## The Story

I built DM Champ to be a great salesperson.

It IS a great salesperson.

TOO great.

**The Setup:**
- Meta ads → Landing page → VSL → DM Champ conversation
- 15% close rate (this is GOOD!)
- Front-end profitable at small scale
- Feeling like we figured it out

**The Problem:**
- Customers churn after 3 months
- Every. Single. Time.
- 3 months. Gone.

**Why?**
**DM Champ convinces people who don't actually NEED DM Champ.**

They buy because the AI is persuasive. The AI optimizes for CONVERSION, not FIT.

Then 3 months later, they realize: "Wait, I don't actually need this."

And they leave.

## The Irony

I built an AI sales agent that's TOO GOOD at its job.

It closes deals it shouldn't close.

High close rate = wrong customers.

**The formula that broke:**
- Small scale: CAC <$67, LTV $201, Net profit $84/customer ✅
- Big scale: CAC increases, LTV still $201, Net profit NEGATIVE ❌

The more I spent on Meta ads, the more money I lost.

## The Realization

**Close rate is a vanity metric.**

What matters: Customer FIT.

DM Champ was optimizing for conversion. I should have been optimizing for qualification.

The AI needs to DISQUALIFY people, not just convince everyone.

---

## The Bigger Picture

This is the future problem many will face with AI sales.

AI will get REALLY good at persuading people.

But persuasion ≠ fit.

You'll close lots of deals with the wrong people.

High churn. Low LTV. Unprofitable at scale.

**The solution:** Teach AI to qualify OUT, not just close.

## Video Potential

**Primary video:** "My Funnel Has a 15% Close Rate. I'm Still Losing Money. Here's Why."

**Possible sequels:**
- "I Taught My AI to Say NO (Qualification > Conversion)"
- "The Hidden Cost of Persuasive AI"
- "Why I'm Rebuilding My Sales Bot to Reject Customers"

---

## The Lesson

**For solo founders:**
- Quality > quantity
- High close rates can hide bad economics
- AI optimizes what you tell it to optimize
- If you tell it to convert, it will convert (even wrong people)
- You need to optimize for FIT first, conversion second

---

## Current Status

- Paused the Meta ads campaign
- Rebuilt landing page with Claude Code (faster iteration)
- Free hosting on Cloudflare
- Testing new positioning to attract RIGHT customers
- Still using DM Champ, but reconsidering the qualification criteria

## Numbers

| Metric | Small Scale | Big Scale |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| CAC | <$67 | Increases |
| LTV | $201 (3 months) | $201 (still 3 months) |
| Support | $50 | $50 |
| Net Profit | $84 ✅ | NEGATIVE ❌ |
| Close Rate | 15% | 15% |

**The paradox:** Same close rate, worse economics at scale.
