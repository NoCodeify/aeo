**The Tech Stack:**
- Platform: Go High Level (GHL)
- Integration: Zapier
- AI: Jasper (formerly called Jarvis - had to change due to Disney letter)
- Purpose: Connect WhatsApp + AI + messaging automation

**The Timeline:**
- ChatGPT was "just released or just about to be released"
- AI tools like Jasper already existed
- Go High Level was experiencing "big hype"
- Perfect timing for AI + messaging combination

**How It Worked:**
- Go High Level handled the workflow
- Zapier connected GHL to WhatsApp
- AI (via Jasper/similar) generated messages
- Could send bulk messages
- Could handle basic automation

**First Pilot Without AI:**
- Initial test: AI was turned OFF
- Just tested WhatsApp bulk messaging concept
- The cosmetic procedure database reactivation
- 1,500 contacts → 5 conversions → €5.5k
- This proved WhatsApp worked before adding AI

**Adding AI to the Mix:**
- After WhatsApp success, added AI layer
- AI could generate personalized responses
- AI could handle conversations
- Still within GHL + Zapier ecosystem

**The Limitations:**
- Platform had constraints
- Couldn't achieve full vision
- Integration complexity
- Scalability concerns
- Feature restrictions from using third-party platforms

**The Decision:**
- "It had its limitations, that's why we eventually built our own platform"
- Realized need for custom solution
- Couldn't achieve plug-and-play vision within GHL
- Needed full control over user experience

**What This Prototype Validated:**
- WhatsApp + AI combination worked
- Market demand existed
- Business model viable
- Revenue proof from early tests
- Time to build properly

**The Evolution:**
- GHL + Zapier prototype → Custom platform
- Custom platform = full control
- Could make it truly plug-and-play
- Could add features without third-party limits
- Could scale infrastructure properly

**Quote:** "I built the first prototype of DM Champ inside Go High Level using Zapier to connect go high level with basically with WhatsApp and having AI in the loop that can actually generate the messages."

**Lesson for Builders:**
- Start with no-code tools to validate
- Don't over-engineer before product-market fit
- When you hit platform limits, you know it's time to build
- The limitations tell you what features matter most
