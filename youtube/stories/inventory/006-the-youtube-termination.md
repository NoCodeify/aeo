**Timing:** Just before hitting €100,000 month  
**Key Details:**
- Channel terminated without warning
- No specific reason given
- Years of work vanished instantly
- Was on track to nearly €100,000 the following month
- Went from planning Lamborghini to zero income
- Strange adjustment period - from €30,000/month to nothing
- Quote: "One day I'm planning my future with spreadsheets, the next day it's all gone"
- Lesson learned: Diversify, adapt, rebuild
- All Excel graphs and projections became worthless
- Determined to rebuild: "If I could build one successful business at 13, I could build another at 17"
