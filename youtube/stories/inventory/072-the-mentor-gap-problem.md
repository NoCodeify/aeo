**The Contrast:**
- Islamic knowledge: Had Sheikh Said, regular lessons
- Business knowledge: Zero Muslim mentors
- Every business guru online wasn't Muslim
**The Challenge:** Everything had to be second-guessed
- "Is this halal?"
- "Can I actually do this?"
**Impact:** Created unnecessary friction in learning business
