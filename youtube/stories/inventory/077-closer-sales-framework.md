**Purpose:** Ethical sales conversations  
**Steps:**

   - "What made you reach out about chat automation?"
2. **L**abel the problem
   - "So you're losing about $5,000/month in missed opportunities?"
3. **O**verview past pain
   - "What have you tried before?"
4. **S**ell the vacation, not the plane
   - "Imagine every customer getting response within 30 seconds"
5. **E**xplain away concerns
   - Address each objection with patience and logic
6. **R**einforce the decision
   - "You made a smart decision. Here's what happens next..."
**Key Principle:** "Sales isn't manipulation - it's helping people get what they already want"
