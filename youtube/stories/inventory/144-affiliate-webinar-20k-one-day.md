## THE STORY

### The Setup

One of our investors (more like a team member who also brings cash) was in a business mastermind. The guy who runs the mastermind? A business/marketing coach with a big audience in the Netherlands.

He loved our product. Perfect fit for what he does. And he's REALLY good at giving webinars.

Me? I'm not a fan of webinars. They feel cringe. But I figured, let's try it.

### The Date: December 12th

500 people signed up for the webinar.
300 actually showed up.

First 60 minutes: He's talking about the product, showing examples, demonstrating what it does.

Then comes the offer. Very sales-y. Very "cringe" for me. But I'm watching.

The offer:
- $67/month
- $670/year

He closes the pitch.

I open the Stripe dashboard.

**BOOM.**

$20,000 in revenue. Within 1-2 minutes.

80 customers. Just like that.
- 20 yearly subscriptions ($13,400 upfront)
- 60 monthly subscriptions ($4,020/month MRR)

It was just crazy to watch happen live.

### The Aftermath (Where We Screwed Up)

We were NOT prepared.

We were using our own system (DM Champ) to book onboarding calls. But some stuff? We STILL hadn't even set it up yet.

And it was December. Holiday season. Everyone on our team was on holiday.

So we've got 80 new customers... and we can't do the calls. We're scrambling to set things up. People are waiting. People are pissed.

Luckily, they didn't leave. Which taught me something about how strong the emotional buy-in was.

### The Churn Reality

These weren't like AppSumo customers (who are very active, testing everything).

These were emotional buyers. They bought on the pitch, not on rational evaluation.

**Churn rates:**
- Month 1: ~20% churn
- Month 2: ~15% churn
- Month 3: ~10% churn

The funny thing? These customers aren't even that active. They bought emotionally, not because they carefully evaluated the features.

### What Actually Saved Us: Yearly Subscriptions

With monthly subscriptions, every month is a decision: "Should I keep this?"

With yearly? They're committed. Less churn.

After 6 months, we reached out to all the monthly subscribers and offered them a discount to upgrade to yearly.

It worked really well. Converted a bunch of them.

## THE NUMBERS

**Immediate Revenue:**
- $20K in 1-2 minutes

**6-Month Upgrade Strategy:**

## THE LESSON

### What I Learned:

1. **Webinars work, even if they feel cringe**
   - Don't let personal bias stop you from testing channels
   - What works for your audience ≠ what you like

2. **Preparation matters MORE at scale**
   - $20K in 2 minutes sounds great
   - But if you can't onboard them? You lose them
   - Scale your operations BEFORE scaling sales

3. **Different buyers = different behavior**
   - AppSumo buyers: Rational, active, testing features
   - Webinar buyers: Emotional, less active, bought on pitch
   - Both are valid, but require different retention strategies

4. **Yearly pricing is critical for emotional buyers**
   - They make decision once (emotionally)
   - Monthly = re-decision every month (more rational)
   - Lock them in yearly while emotion is high

5. **Strategic affiliates > paid ads**
   - This partner had audience + credibility
   - Trusted recommendation > cold ad
   - $20K in one day vs. slow ad spend

6. **Holiday timing matters**
   - Don't launch when your team is unavailable
   - Onboarding failures hurt trust
   - Plan around capacity, not just sales goals
