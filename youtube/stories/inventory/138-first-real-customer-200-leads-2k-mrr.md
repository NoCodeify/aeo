**The Acquisition:**
- Channel: Cold email via Instantly
- Target: Local clinics
- Response: 3 clinics interested
- Follow-up: Only bothered with 1 of them
- "If I followed up with other two, I'm sure they would have signed up as well"

**The Timing:**
- This was during prototype phase
- "Early stages of DM Champ"
- Platform still being built
- Wasn't even called DM Champ yet
- "It was called something else at the moment"

**The Goal:**
- "Get basically some real beta testers"
- Needed validation with real customers
- Needed to see if it worked outside of own clinic (FueGenix)
- Just needed ONE to prove concept

**What Was Offered:**
- Don't remember exact offer
- Probably: Database reactivation via WhatsApp + AI
- Same playbook as the €5.5k proof of concept
- Beta pricing or special early access

**The Database:**
- Client had old lead list
- Less than 200 leads total
- "Not even 200 leads"
- People who had inquired but never converted
- Cold/old leads collecting dust

**The Process:**
- Same as previous success:
  - Upload the list (200 contacts)
  - Send WhatsApp message
  - AI had conversations (THIS time AI was on)
  - AI convinced them to make bookings

**The Results:**
- Generated recurring revenue
- "About two grand per month" in recurring revenue
- Just from 200 contacts
- Extremely high ROI for client

**What Happened After:**
- "They eventually stopped using the platform"
- Don't know why they churned
- No follow-up on reason

**The Plot Twist:**
- "Funny story: they messaged us yesterday"
- This is 2025, original story from 2023
- "We wanna, we're interested again"
- Customer coming back after ~2 years
- "I guess that's good"

**The Significance:**
- First customer who PAID (not FueGenix, not partner)
- Proof that model worked for external clients
- Proof that small databases could generate significant revenue
- Validated the AI + WhatsApp combination
- Even with churn, customer saw enough value to return

**The Missed Opportunity:**
- Had 3 interested prospects
- Only followed up with 1
- Could have had 3x early validation
- Classic founder mistake: not following up

**Quote:** "They eventually stopped using the platform. I don't know why. But funny thing, yesterday they messaged us saying hey, we wanna, we're interested again."

**Current Recommendation Based on This:**
- "If you have a list of old customers, upload them, send a bulk WhatsApp message"
- "Out of those you can expect 1-2% conversion rate"
- "If you have 1,000 numbers, you can expect 10-20 customers"
- "It's really easy... same day you'll start getting bookings or even orders"
