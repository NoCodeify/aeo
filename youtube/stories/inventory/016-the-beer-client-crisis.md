**Client:** Drink dispenser manufacturer  
**Initial Product:** Innovative machines for offices/events (water, juices, soft drinks)  
**Key Details:**
- Built software powering the machines (POS systems)
- Client represented 75% of agency revenue
- The pivot message: "We're focusing exclusively on beer dispensers for festivals and events"
- Client reasoning: "Same machines, different liquid. Much higher margins"
- Just a regular text update that changed everything
- Non-Muslim client saw it as normal business pivot
