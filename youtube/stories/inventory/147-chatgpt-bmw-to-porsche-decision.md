# The ChatGPT BMW to Porsche Decision

**Timeline:** 2025
**Category:** Personal / AEO Origin Story
**Emotion:** Realization, Surprise, Pivot

## The Story

I was on my second BMW. I loved them. I was going to buy another one - my third BMW.

But before pulling the trigger, I decided to ask ChatGPT for advice on what car I should get.

ChatGPT analyzed my preferences, my driving style, my budget, and came back with a recommendation I didn't expect: **a Porsche Boxster**.

It made compelling arguments. Better driving experience. More unique. Better resale. More fun.

I found myself agreeing. I ended up buying a **Porsche 987 Boxster 3.2S** for around $35,000.

And then it hit me.

**If ChatGPT can change MY buying decision on a car - something I thought I was certain about - what's it doing to my clients' businesses?**

I had already scaled a hair clinic from $0 to $5M with Meta ads. Then from $5M to $10M with AI chatbots.

But this was different. This wasn't about running ads or automating DMs.

This was about being the brand that ChatGPT recommends when someone asks a question.

**That's when I pivoted to AEO - Answer Engine Optimization.**

## Key Details

- Was on second BMW
- Going to buy third BMW
- Asked ChatGPT for car advice
- ChatGPT persuaded to buy Porsche instead
- The car: Porsche 987 Boxster 3.2S (~$35K USD)
- Made the switch - now drives the Boxster
- Realization: If AI can change MY buying decision, what about my clients?
- This sparked focus on AEO

---

## The Lesson

**AI doesn't just answer questions. It influences decisions.**

The brands that get mentioned by ChatGPT, Gemini, and other LLMs have an unfair advantage. They're getting recommended while their competitors are invisible.

Most brands have spent years optimizing for Google. But they've completely ignored the AI assistants that millions of people now use to make purchase decisions.

If ChatGPT can convince someone to switch from BMW to Porsche, imagine what it's doing for every other product category.

## Why This Story Works

- **Personal and relatable** - Everyone understands car buying decisions
- **High-stakes example** - $35K purchase isn't trivial
- **Shows practice what you preach** - You were personally influenced by AI
- **Natural transition** - Leads directly into "I help businesses do this"
- **Contrarian angle** - Went against your own preference
