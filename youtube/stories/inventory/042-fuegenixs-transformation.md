**Timeline:** Started during COVID, Year 5 with DM Champ

**The Beginning (During COVID):**
- Started during COVID pandemic
- Literally from zero
- Hair transplant clinic in the Netherlands (Europe)
- "We started about five years ago... during COVID"
- "Literally we started from scratch zero"

**Year 1:**
- Hit €1 million in revenue
- "Within a year we already hit 1 million in revenue"
- Extremely fast growth from zero
- High profit margin business model

**Year 2-3:**
- Scaled to €3 million revenue
- "Year two or three we scaled it to 3 million"
- Systematic marketing and tech improvements
- Building foundation for future scale

**Year 4 (Before DM Champ):**
- €5 million revenue
- Losing €50K+ per month in missed leads
- Messages at 10 PM sat until morning
- By morning, prospects booked elsewhere
- "This is pretty high profit margin business"

**Year 5 (After DM Champ):**
- Instant response to all inquiries
- AI handling initial conversations
- Building trust before human interaction
- Prospects 80% sold before talking to surgeon
- Result: Scaled from €5 million to over €10 million
- More than doubled revenue in single year
- "A huge chunk of that growth? Never missing a lead"

**Growth Factors:**
- High profit margins enabled reinvestment
- Systematic approach to marketing
- Tech-first mentality
- Eventually: AI automation via DM Champ
- Never missing leads was breakthrough moment

**Quote:** "We started about five years ago just I think during COVID... literally we started from scratch zero. And I think within a year we already hit 1 million in revenue and then year two or three we scaled it to 3 million. And this is pretty high profit margin business."
