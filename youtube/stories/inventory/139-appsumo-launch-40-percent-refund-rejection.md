**Pre-Launch Context:**
- Had bought 1-2 products from AppSumo before
- One product used successfully
- One product: "so many bugs it was useless, wasn't usable at all"
- Knew what AppSumo was but "never really knew the community behind it"
- Zero experience with AppSumo deal structure
- No guidance from AppSumo team on pricing/features

**The Launch (November 2024):**
- Listed as self-select deal
- Total customers: 300
- Total revenue: ~€20k
- Revenue split: 40/60 (unclear which side gets which)
- "No idea about how we should structure our deal or pricing"

**The Refund Problem:**
- Refund rate: 40%
- Net customers after refunds: ~200
- Most refunds: cheapest package tier
- "Those were the users that were probably just trying it out and just refunding it"
- People testing product with no commitment

**Why Refunds Were High:**
- Improper pricing structure
- Cheapest tier attracted tire-kickers
- No clear feature differentiation
- First-time AppSumo seller mistakes
- "We didn't know how to do the pricing, what features to put in"

**What Went Right:**
- €20k revenue for self-listed deal is "pretty good"
- Seen Reddit posts about AppSumo Select deals making less than €20k
- Customer feedback was "really good"
- "Users from AppSumo give really good feedback compared to our other users"
- 200 retained customers provided valuable product insights

**The Relaunch Plan:**
- Canceled listing in March/April 2025
- Planned "amazing relaunch"
- "Much better deals"
- Added: Lifetime credits (recurring)
- Improved pricing structure
- Learned from first launch mistakes

**The Approval Process:**
- Went through entire AppSumo approval process
- Everything approved
- "Fully approved until there was like one final check remaining by someone higher up"
- First time: process was "pretty quick"
- This time: "Taking weeks and weeks and weeks"

**The Follow-Up Hell:**
- Had to follow up 2-3 times in one month
- AppSumo wouldn't respond
- No explanation given
- After ~5 weeks: randomly checked dashboard

**The Rejection:**
- Dashboard: "Your application is disapproved"
- No explanation in dashboard
- Sent email asking why
- "They didn't explain anything either"

**The Reddit Post:**
- Posted on Reddit about the experience
- DM Champ USERS found the post and defended the product
- "How amazing our product is and we should get listed back"
- Noah Kagan (AppSumo CEO) commented
- "Some like high ranking people at AppSumo also commented"
- Said they would "look into it this and that"
- "Just making themselves look good to the public really"

**The Final Answer (2-3 weeks later):**
- Followed up again after their public promises
- "What's the problem?"
- New policy revealed: >30% refund rate = can't relist
- "They got new policy if your refund rate is above 30% you're not allowed to relist"
- No communication of this policy during 5-week wait
- Should have been told immediately

**The Frustration:**
- "They just should have told us"
- Wasted weeks of planning
- Set up entire relaunch campaign
- Full approval given, then pulled
- Public promises on Reddit, then ghosted
- "Not waste our time"

**The What-If:**
- "If we actually knew how to properly list our first listing"
- "We wouldn't have had those 40%"
- "We would have had a much lower refund rate"
- "This launch would have been ten times bigger"
- First-time mistakes cost second opportunity

**The Platform Economics:**
- Self-listing: 40/60 split (possibly 40% to seller)
- AppSumo Select: "Custom deal"
- Select split: "Ridiculous in favor of AppSumo"
- "Then they're going, they're always surprised that the company shuts down a year later"
- "They took such a big part of the piece"
- "If you really can just give the companies a bigger share maybe they can survive for longer"

**What Remains Positive:**
- 200 customers still providing feedback
- "They're still good"
- "Customers have given us good feedback"
- Despite the platform drama, user quality high
- Just wish for transparency instead of time-wasting

**Quote:** "I just wish they would just be straight up with the second listing and not waste our time. Because like I said, we set everything up, we were approved and then they just shut the door on us."

**Lessons:**
1. Get pricing structure right the first time
2. Study platform best practices before launching
3. Public promises from executives mean nothing
4. Platform policies change without notice
5. Quality users matter more than quantity
6. 40% refund rate is fixable with better packaging
