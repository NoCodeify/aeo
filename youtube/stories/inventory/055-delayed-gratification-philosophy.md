**Example:** Munib's Porsche purchase  
**The Principle:**
- Not "no gratification" but "delayed gratification"
- No Lamborghini after first good month
- No penthouse office to impress
- Wait until business can afford it without affecting growth
- 5 years of discipline before luxury purchases
- Quote: "Richness is not having many possessions, but richness is being content with oneself"
