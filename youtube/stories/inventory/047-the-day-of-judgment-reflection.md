**During:** Gain Impact beer client crisis  
**The Question:**
- "How could I stand in front of Allah on the Day of Judgment?"
- "What would I say? 'My partner said it was okay'?"
- Realization: We're all questioned individually
- His choices were his, mine had to be mine
- Fear of Allah testing through success
