**Context:** Running gaming YouTube channel
**The Effort:**
- Creating gaming montages with intense effort
- Adding complex effects and transitions
- Adding sound effects and music
- Spending hours perfecting 2-3 minute videos
- Putting "heart and soul" into editing

**The Market Response:**
- Audience comments: "This is great, but..."
- What they actually wanted: raw footage
- No effects, no transitions, just gameplay
- Complete opposite of what was being created

**The Impact:**
- "It hit me hard" - painful realization
- All the editing work was wasted effort
- Audience preferences > creator preferences

**The Lesson:**
- Doesn't matter what YOU like as creator
- Must listen to customers/audience
- Product must serve market, not ego
- Early lesson that still guides business today

**Connection to Current Business:**
- At DM Champ: "We're doing that... we've listened a bit too much"
- Balance needed between listening and vision
- But ignoring market = guaranteed failure

**Quote:** "It doesn't really matter what you like if your customers or the audience want something else, you have to listen."
