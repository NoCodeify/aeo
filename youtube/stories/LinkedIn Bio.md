If you're here from my posts about WhatsApp automation, here's what our clients are actually achieving:

$2,000,000+ - Revenue generated for medical practice from WhatsApp-qualified leads
50% - Booking rate for recruitment firm from WhatsApp conversations
33% - Website chat to appointment rate for local bike shop
10% - Close rate on lead magnet opt-ins (vs. typical email sequences)
2% - Dead database reactivation rate
#1 - Guaranteed local ranking for restaurants through review automation

As CMO of FueGenix, I scaled revenue from $0 to $3M in two years. During this time, I launched SMB360.ai to help other businesses grow through digital marketing.

Working with 20+ clients across Miami, London, and Dubai, I noticed a consistent pattern: WhatsApp had 98% open rates while email struggled at 20%. Yet businesses kept investing in channels their customers ignored.

I shut down SMB360.ai to focus on building DM Champ: AI specifically designed for WhatsApp's conversational environment.

Most WhatsApp AI is embarrassingly robotic. You know it, your customers know it, and deals die because of it.

We built different. Our AI is so human-like that people have full conversations, ask follow-up questions, share concerns, even make small talk, never realizing they're talking to AI.

Here's proof: We use our own AI to sell lead magnets. After closing the sale, we reveal: "By the way, did you know you've been talking to AI this entire time?" The shock is universal. Then we upsell DM Champ itself.

Why? Because we didn't just connect ChatGPT to WhatsApp and call it a day. We trained our AI on thousands of actual sales conversations that closed deals. It knows when to push, when to back off, when to joke, when to empathize.

The result: Conversations that last days or weeks (not minutes), with context retained across every interaction, closing deals at 11 PM on Sundays.

After implementing DM Champ, FueGenix grew from $5M to $10M in 12 months. We now power 100+ businesses worldwide.

Your customers check WhatsApp 150+ times daily. While competitors fight over 20% email opens, you could be getting 98% message reads in the app your customers prefer.
