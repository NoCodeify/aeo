## SECTION 1: PERSONAL STORY HOOK (0:00 - 1:00)

**Purpose:** Hook with relatable personal experience, not stats or claims.

### The Situation
> "So [personal situation - relatable]..."

### The Moment
> "[What happened / what you discovered]"

### The Realization
> "And that's when it hit me. [Connect to viewer's situation]"
>
> "What is it doing to YOUR [customers/business/etc]?"

**Voice Check:** Does this sound like explaining to a friend? No essay language.

---

## SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM (1:00 - 2:30)

**Purpose:** SHOW the problem is real through your testing/experience.

### What You Found
> "So I started testing..."
>
> "[What you discovered - be specific]"

### Make It Visual
> "In every [industry], there's [handful doing X]. And everyone else? [Y]."

### The Question
> "So the question is: which one are you?"

**Transition Check:** Does this flow naturally from the hook?

---

## SECTION 3: WHY [ASSUMPTION] DOESN'T WORK (2:30 - 4:00)

**Purpose:** Challenge what they think they know.

### The Assumption
> "Now you might be thinking, [common assumption]. Right?"
>
> "Well here's the thing..."

### The Visual Metaphor
> "Think about it like this. [Visual comparison they can picture]"
>
> "[Extend the metaphor to make the point]"

**Metaphor Check:** Can they literally picture this in their head?

---

## SECTION 4: THE INSIGHT (4:00 - 6:00)

**Purpose:** The framework/insight that explains what actually matters.

### The Question
> "So what does [X] actually care about?"
>
> "It comes down to [number] things."

### Thing 1

>
> "[Visual metaphor to explain it]"

### Thing 2
> "Second, [concept]."
>
> "[Visual metaphor to explain it]"

### Thing 3
> "Third, [concept]."
>
> "[Visual metaphor to explain it]"

### Summary + Tension Raise
> "So that's it. [Recap in one line]."
>
> "But does this actually work? Let me show you."

**Tension Check:** Did you raise tension again after the summary?

---

## SECTION 5: PROOF - CASE STUDY (6:00 - 7:30)

**Purpose:** Show it works through specific case study.

### The Setup
> "So I had a client. [NAME]. [Brief context]."
>
> "[Specific detail that adds credibility - pricing, situation]"

### The Before
> "When we started, [what you tested]. They weren't [result]. Completely [state]."

### The After
> "[Timeframe] later, [same test]. Now they're [result]. Consistently."
>
> "[Add detail about what the result looks like]"

### What You Did
> "What did we do? [Brief summary of actions]."
>
> "[Timeframe]. Not [longer time]. This took [timeframe] and not [longer]."

**Specificity Check:** Did you include name, pricing, timeline?

---

## SECTION 6: THE FIX (7:30 - 9:30)

**Purpose:** What to do about it. Specific, actionable.

### The Transition
> "So how do you do the same thing for your business? Let me break it down."

### Step 1
> "Step one, [action]."
>
> "[Brief explanation]"

### Step 2
> "Step two, [action]."
>
> "[Brief explanation with callback to earlier concept if relevant]"

### Step 3
> "Step three, [action]."
>
> "[Brief explanation]"

### Step 4
> "Step four, [action]."
>
> "[Make it accessible - 'You don't need to know how to do this. Just tell your developer X.']"

### Step 5
> "And step five, [action]."
>
> "[Brief explanation]"

**Transition Check:** Did you use "So how do you do the same thing?" to bridge from proof?

---

## SECTION 7: CALLBACK + TAKEAWAY (9:30 - 10:30)

**Purpose:** Return to opening story, deliver single takeaway.

### Acknowledge the Work
> "Now look, I know that sounds like a lot. But here's why it matters."

### The Callback
> "The way [relevant trend] is changing. Fast."
>
> "[Return to your opening story - 'I went from X to Y because of Z.']"
>
> "Your [customers/audience] are doing the same thing right now."

### The Question
> "The question is: are you [showing up / visible / etc] when they ask?"

### The Takeaway
> "So that's it. [X] doesn't care about [Y]. It cares about [A, B, and C]."
>
> "Fix those [number] things and you will [result]. It's not complicated. It just takes focus."

**Callback Check:** Did you return to the opening story?

---

## SECTION 8: CTA (10:30 - end)

**Purpose:** Direct to aeoprotocol.ai or next video.

### The Bridge

>
> "That's where I break down everything in detail."

**OR for video-to-video:**
