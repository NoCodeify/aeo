## Layer 1: Radio Edit (Audio Foundation)

**Goal:** Create the audio backbone. This determines final video length.

### Process:
1. Import best takes of talking head
2. Assemble in script order
3. Cut all verbal filler (umms, ahhs, "so", "basically")
4. Cut pauses longer than 2 seconds
5. Keep natural rhythm (don't over-cut)

### Pacing Guide:
- **Hook (0:00-0:45):** FAST - tight cuts, high energy
- **Setup (0:45-2:00):** MEDIUM - some breathing room
- **Main Content (2:00-8:00):** VARIED - fast for transitions, slower for key points
- **Payoff (8:00-9:30):** MEDIUM - let points land
- **CTA (9:30-10:00):** FAST - quick, clear ending

### Audio Processing:
- [ ] Normalize to -3dB
- [ ] Light compression for consistency
- [ ] Remove background noise
- [ ] De-ess if needed

## Layer 2: B-Roll Coverage

**Goal:** Support talking head with visuals every 10-15 seconds.

### B-Roll Placement:
| Timestamp | B-Roll | Duration | Transition |
|-----------|--------|----------|------------|
| [Time] | [Description] | [X sec] | [Cut/Fade] |
| [Time] | [Description] | [X sec] | [Cut/Fade] |
| [Time] | [Description] | [X sec] | [Cut/Fade] |

### B-Roll Rules:
- Never more than 15 seconds of talking head without visual
- B-roll supports what's being said (not random)
- Duration matches the point being made
- Simple cuts work (no fancy transitions needed)

---

## Layer 3: GIF Placement

**Goal:** Add retention beats every 45-60 seconds.

### GIF Placement:
| Timestamp | GIF Description | Search Query | Duration |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| [Time] | [Emotion/moment] | "[Query]" | [1-3 sec] |
| [Time] | [Emotion/moment] | "[Query]" | [1-3 sec] |

### GIF Rules:
- AFTER the statement (punctuate, don't interrupt)
- Quick cut to GIF, quick cut back
- Maximum 3 seconds per GIF
- Don't overuse (1 per 45-60 seconds max)

---

## Layer 4: Text Overlays

**Goal:** Reinforce key points visually.

### Text Overlay Placement:
| Timestamp | Text | Style | Duration |
|-----------|------|-------|----------|
| [Time] | "[Key stat/quote]" | Lower third | [X sec] |
| [Time] | "[Framework name]" | Title card | [X sec] |

### Text Overlay Rules:
- Large font (readable on mobile)
- High contrast
- Maximum 5-7 words
- On screen for entire sentence
- Fade in/out (no spinning or complex animations)

---
