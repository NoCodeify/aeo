# Thumbnail Style Guide

Minimal Apple aesthetic. Pure black, glossy 3D icons, clean typography.

---

## Visual Style: Minimal Apple Aesthetic

**The look:** Pure black background, glossy 3D app icons, clean Porsche font text with smooth gradient. Think Apple keynote product shots, not Netflix movie posters.

**Reference:** AntiGravity YouTube channel thumbnails (glossy icons + black + chrome text)

**What we DO NOT do:**
- No cinematic color grading (no navy, no crushed blacks, no vignette)
- No heavy text effects (no 6px strokes, no heavy drop shadows, no outer glow)
- No faces (new channel, zero recognition value - revisit when channel grows)
- No freeze frames from video
- No busy backgrounds or gradients
- No "Netflix thumbnail" aesthetic

---

## Workflow

1. **Choose thumbnail types** (combine 2-3 from the type library below)
2. **Write the text** (ALL CAPS, 3-5 words max)
3. **Generate with Imagen** using the prompt template below
4. **Review at mobile size** (160x90px) on thumbsup.tv
5. **Export** as JPEG under 2MB

---

## Brand Philosophy

**The 1+1=3 Rule:** Title and thumbnail COMPLEMENT, not repeat.
- Title = what (story setup, search keyword)
- Thumbnail = why it matters (stakes/emotion/result)
- If your thumbnail text appears in your title, start over.

## Thumbnail Types (CRITICAL - Pick 2-3)

Every viral thumbnail combines multiple types. Never use just one.

### The 10 Types

| # | Type | What It Does | Example |
|---|------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Big Numbers** | Dollar amounts, percentages, counts that shock | "$100K", "90%", "50K PROJECT" |
| 2 | **Shock/Curiosity** | Something unexpected that demands a click | Weird object, surprising visual |
| 3 | **Simple/Minimal** | Just one object or screenshot, nothing else | A single icon, a red button |
| 4 | **Social Hacking** | Recognizable face/brand from your niche | Well-known logo, familiar product |
| 5 | **Creator + Something Bigger** | You next to an oversized or impressive object | (deferred until face is added) |
| 6 | **Header Text** | Bold text giving context the title doesn't | Statement, claim, context line |
| 7 | **Comparison** | Before/after, vs., old/new side by side | Split screen, icons with "+" between |
| 8 | **Blur/Mystery** | Key element blurred so people click to find out | Blurred result, blurred number |
| 9 | **Weird Object** | Something that doesn't belong, makes you look twice | NFC card on a coding video |
| 10 | **Branded/Recognizable** | Consistent visual identity across videos | Same color system, same icon style |

### Combination Strategy (THE SECRET)

**Always combine 2-3 types.** This is what separates amateur thumbnails from viral ones.

| Video Topic | Type Combo | Thumbnail Concept |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| "5 Things I Built" | Header + Simple + Branded | "5 REAL BUILDS" text, Claude icon center, 5 project icons orbiting |
| "Claude Code Teams" | Comparison + Header + Branded | Two icons with "+" between, "TEAM MODE" text |
| "Best Practices" | Simple + Header + Branded | Checklist icon, "DO THIS" text |
| "Claude Code vs Cursor" | Comparison + Social Hacking | Side-by-side logos with "+" or "VS" |

## Typography

### Font
- **Style:** Porsche font
- **Weight:** Bold or heavy
- **Case:** ALL CAPS ALWAYS
- **No exceptions.** Every text element is uppercase.

### Text Gradient (CRITICAL)
- Smooth gradient from **bright white** at top to **light silver-gray** at bottom
- The gradient must be **very gradual and smooth** - never abrupt or harsh
- Soft diffused white glow behind the text
- NO heavy strokes, NO heavy drop shadows, NO colored outer glows
- The text should look like polished chrome/silver, not like a gaming thumbnail

### Text Sizing

| Element | Frame Height % | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Hero text** | 20-35% | "$100K", "5 REAL BUILDS" |
| **Secondary** | 10-15% | "BUILT WITH AI", "ALL REAL" |

### Text Rules
- 3-5 words maximum
- ALL CAPS always
- Does NOT repeat title words
- Readable at 160x90px (mobile)

---

## Visual Elements: Glossy 3D App Icons

### Style
- **iOS-style rounded corner app icons** with glossy 3D finish
- Each icon represents a project, tool, or concept
- Each icon has its **own color** with a matching soft glow behind it
- Icons float on pure black background

### Icon Color Palette

| Project | Icon Color | Symbol |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **AI Chat / DM Champ** | Teal | Chat bubble |
| **CI/CD / Code** | Purple | Terminal / cursor prompt |
| **Email Agent** | Blue | Envelope with sparkle |
| **NFC / Access Control** | Gold | NFC contactless waves |
| **AEO / Search** | Orange | Magnifying glass |
| **Claude / AI** | Coral-orange on dark | Stylized "A" letter |

### Icon Rules
- Each icon glows its own color softly against the black
- Icons should look premium and glossy, like real app icons
- Center icon (if using hub layout) should be larger (~35% frame height)
- Satellite icons should be smaller (~15-20% frame height)
- Keep spacing clean - icons should breathe

## Layouts

### Layout A: Icon Row (for lists, multiple items)
```
+---------------------------------------+
|                                       |
|         [HERO TEXT - ALL CAPS]        |
|                                       |
|  [icon] [icon] [icon] [icon] [icon]  |
|                                       |
+---------------------------------------+
```
Best for: "$100K", "ALL REAL", list-style videos

### Layout B: Hub + Satellites (for "built with X" concepts)
```
+---------------------------------------+
|                                       |
|         [HERO TEXT - ALL CAPS]        |
|                                       |
|    [sm]    [CENTER ICON]    [sm]     |
|       [sm]            [sm]           |
|                                       |
+---------------------------------------+
```
Best for: "5 REAL BUILDS" with Claude icon center, project icons orbiting

### Layout C: Two Icons + Plus (for combinations, integrations)
```
+---------------------------------------+
|                                       |
|         [HERO TEXT - ALL CAPS]        |
|                                       |
|      [ICON]    +    [ICON]           |
|                                       |
|         [SECONDARY TEXT]              |
+---------------------------------------+
```
Best for: "ABSURD COMBINATION", tool integrations, vs. comparisons

## Background

- **Pure black (#000000).** Not navy. Not dark gray. Not gradient. Black.
- The only "color" comes from icon glows bleeding softly into the black
- No patterns, no textures, no vignettes

---

## Imagen Prompt Template

Use this structure for every thumbnail generation:

```
YouTube thumbnail on pure black background. [LAYOUT DESCRIPTION - icons,
positions, sizes]. [ICON DESCRIPTIONS - each icon's color, symbol, glow].
Above [or position], clean text reading "[TEXT IN ALL CAPS]" in the Porsche font. ALL CAPS.
ALL CAPS. The text has a very smooth subtle gradient from bright white at
the top to light silver-gray at the bottom, with a very soft diffused white
glow behind it. The gradient must be very gradual and smooth, not abrupt.
Pure black background. Minimal, glossy, premium Apple aesthetic. No noise,
no borders, no people, no faces. Professional YouTube thumbnail 1920x1080.
```

**Always specify:**
- "Porsche font"
- "ALL CAPS"
- "very smooth subtle gradient from bright white to light silver-gray"
- "very gradual and smooth, not abrupt"
- "pure black background"
- "glossy 3D rounded-corner app icons"
- "No people, no faces"

## Getting Inspiration

**Do NOT copy thumbnails from channels in your niche.** If 5 Claude Code channels all have the same thumbnail style, hopping on that train makes you a copycat.

**Instead:**
1. Browse channels in completely different niches (cooking, fitness, finance, gaming)
2. Find thumbnail concepts that catch YOUR eye
3. Adapt the concept to your topic

**Key reference:** AntiGravity channel - glossy icons on black, clean chrome text

---

## Pre-Publish Testing

1. **thumbsup.tv** - Upload title + thumbnail, see how it looks on a simulated YouTube homepage
2. **Mobile check** - View at 160x90px. Can you read the text?
3. **Competitor check** - Search your target keyword. Does yours look different?
4. **5-second test** - Show someone for 5 seconds. Can they tell what the video is about?

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)

| Category | Never | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **Style** | Cinematic color grading / Netflix look | Not our aesthetic |
| **Style** | Heavy strokes, drop shadows, outer glows | Looks like gaming thumbnails |
| **Style** | Navy/dark backgrounds (use pure black) | Doesn't match Apple aesthetic |
| **Text** | Lowercase or mixed case | Always ALL CAPS |
| **Text** | Abrupt chrome gradient | Must be smooth and gradual |
| **Text** | Repeating the title | Wastes persuasion real estate |
| **Text** | More than 5 words | Unreadable at mobile |
| **Face** | Adding face to thumbnail (for now) | Zero recognition at 0 subs |
| **Visual** | Red arrows and circles | 2015 YouTube |
| **Visual** | Busy backgrounds or patterns | Competes with icons |
| **Concept** | Using only one thumbnail type | Won't stand out |
| **Concept** | Copying competitors in your niche | Becomes a copycat |

---

## Face Policy

**Current:** No face. Channel has zero subs, face adds no recognition value.

**When to add face:** Revisit when channel reaches ~2-5K subscribers. At that point, viewers start recognizing you and the face becomes a scroll-stopper instead of dead space.

**When face is added:** Face goes on right third, icons and text adjust to left 60%. Same black background, same icon style, same text style.

---

## A/B Testing Protocol

1. **Test ONE variable** at a time (text OR layout OR icon style)
2. **Minimum 48 hours** with sufficient impressions
3. **Check mobile CTR specifically** (70%+ views are mobile)
4. **Document winners** and update this style guide
5. **Archive losers** with notes on why they failed
