# Thumbnail Style Guide: AEO Channel

Professional thumbnail specifications for all YouTube content.

---

## Workflow

1. **Record video** as normal
2. **Extract freeze frame** with correct expression
3. **Run through Imagen** with prompt to add text/effects
4. **Review at mobile size** (160x90px)
5. **Export** as JPEG under 2MB

**Imagen does:**
- Keeps your face/expression exactly as-is
- Applies cinematic color grading
- Adds professional text with effects
- Adds visual metaphors/accents
- Repositions you slightly if needed

---

## Brand Philosophy

**Universal Hook Strategy:** Niche B2B content struggles with CTR. Solution: lead with universal desires (money, customers, survival), make the niche (AEO) the *reveal*, not the hook.

**The 1+1=3 Rule:** Title and thumbnail COMPLEMENT, not repeat.
- Title = what (story setup)
- Thumbnail = why it matters (stakes/emotion)

---

## Professional Text Effects (MANDATORY)

Every text element needs this effects stack:

### Effect Specifications

| Effect | Hero Text | Secondary Text |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Stroke** | 6px black (#000000) | 4px black |
| **Drop Shadow** | 12px offset, 25px blur, 90% black | 8px offset, 15px blur, 80% black |
| **Outer Glow** | 40px feather, 25-30% opacity | 20px feather, 15-20% opacity |
| **Inner Bevel** | Subtle 3D depth | Optional |

### Why This Matters

| Without Effects | With Effects |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Flat, amateur | Depth, dimension |
| Disappears on mobile | Pops off any background |
| Looks like MS Paint | Looks like Netflix |

---

## Text Sizing

| Element | Frame Height % | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Hero word** | 25-40% | "LOSING", "#1", "FIRST" |
| **Secondary** | 12-18% | "HALF ARE", "NOW", "DO THIS" |
| **Tertiary** | 8-12% | Rarely used |

**Mobile Test:** If you can't read it clearly at 160x90px, it's too small.

---

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors

| Element | Color | Hex | When to Use |
|---------|-------|-----|-------------|
| **Default Hero** | Electric Yellow | `#FFE135` | Success, money, priority |
| **Warning Hero** | Warning Red | `#FF4444` | Losing, failing, danger |
| **Achievement Hero** | Warm Gold | `#C9A86C` | Proof, results, premium |
| **Tech Hero** | Teal | `#00D4FF` | AI, new, modern |
| **Secondary Text** | White | `#FFFFFF` | Always for supporting text |
| **All Strokes** | Black | `#000000` | Every text element |

### Color Grade Targets

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Blacks** | Raw black | Navy `#0A1628` |
| **Shadows** | Neutral | +5% teal tint |
| **Highlights** | Raw | Slight warmth |
| **Saturation** | Raw | -10-15% midtones |
| **Contrast** | Raw | +15-20% |

---

## Cinematic Color Grading

Apply to EVERY freeze frame before/during Imagen processing:

```
1. Crush blacks to deep navy (#0A1628)
2. Increase contrast 15-20%
3. Desaturate midtones 10-15% (protect skin tones)
4. Add subtle teal to shadows (#00D4FF at 5%)
5. Add subtle warmth to highlights
6. Apply dark vignette around all edges
7. Result: Netflix thumbnail, not webcam screenshot
```

## Layout Specification

```
+---------------------------------------+
|                                       |
|  [HERO TEXT - yellow/red/gold]  [YOU] |
|  [Secondary - white]            RIGHT |
|                                  40%  |
|  [Visual Metaphor]               OF   |
|  (subtle accent)                FRAME |
|                                       |
|                          [TIMESTAMP]  |
+---------------------------------------+
```

### Fixed Elements

| Element | Position | Size |
|---------|----------|------|
| **You (face)** | Right side | 40% of frame width |
| **Hero text** | Upper-left | 8% from left, 15% from top |
| **Secondary text** | Below hero | Left-aligned with hero |
| **Visual metaphor** | Lower-left or center | 70-150px |
| **Clear zone** | Bottom-right | For YouTube timestamp |

---

## Visual Metaphor Library

### By Video Type

| Concept | Visual | Color | Opacity |
|---------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Money/Stakes** | Dollar amount, car silhouette | Gold `#C9A86C` | 40-50% |
| **Invisible** | Fading logo, ghost effect | Gray `#6B7280` | 30-60% fade |
| **Success/Proof** | Trophy, medal, #1 badge | Gold `#C9A86C` | 40-50% |
| **Transition** | Old icon → new icon | Gray → Teal | 35% → 80% |
| **Priority** | Arrow pointing right, "1" badge | Yellow `#FFE135` | 70% |
| **Decline/Loss** | Downward graph, arrow | Red `#FF4444` | 50-60% |

### Rules

- **ONE** visual metaphor per thumbnail (maximum)
- Should be **subtle accent**, not hero element
- Must **integrate** with color grade (not look pasted on)
- **Never** competes with text or face for attention

## A/B Testing Protocol

When testing thumbnails:

1. **Test ONE variable** at a time (text OR color OR expression)
2. **Minimum 48 hours** with sufficient impressions
3. **Check mobile CTR specifically** (70%+ views are mobile)
4. **Document winners** and update this style guide
5. **Archive losers** with notes on why they failed
