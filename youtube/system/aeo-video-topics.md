# AEO Video Topics Bank

Organized by Ed Lawrence's gap strategy and title format effectiveness.

## Channel Positioning

**Avatar:** Business owners and marketers who've invested in SEO/digital marketing but are invisible to ChatGPT/Gemini.

**Credibility Stack:**
1. Scaled hair clinic $0 -> $5M with Meta ads (3 years)
2. Scaled same clinic $5M -> $10M with AI chatbots
3. ChatGPT convinced ME to buy a Porsche instead of BMW

**Enemy:** Traditional SEO agencies that ignore AI search.

**Belief:** "SEO is dying. The brands that win in 2026+ will be the ones ChatGPT recommends."

**Space:** THE AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) expert.

## Gap Strategy Analysis

AEO content fills multiple gaps:
- **Topic Gap**: AEO/LLM optimization is barely covered on YouTube
- **Skill Gap**: Pro-level insights (not "what is SEO" beginner content)
- **Credibility Gap**: Real results ($0->$10M), real audits, real data
- **Contrarian Gap**: "SEO is dead, AEO is the future"
