# Hook Templates Reference

Operational reference for the hook-generator agent. Read fully before generating any hook.

---

## 1. Hook Philosophy

Every hook must:

- Confirm the click within 5-10s (viewer thinks "yes, this is what I wanted")
- Build trust through vulnerability OR credibility (never both at once)
- Create anticipation (need to see what comes next)
- Feel authentic and conversational (no guru energy, no hype)
- Work for first-time viewers (no assumed context)
- Set up the script WITHOUT spoiling it

The hook is a contract: "stay, and here's what you get." Break that contract and retention drops.

---

## 2. The 6 Hook Templates

### Template F: Observation -> Promise -> Proof

**PRIMARY TEMPLATE. Use 3-4x per 10 videos.**

| Element | Timing | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| State observation | 0-5s | Get to value immediately |
| Promise explanation | 5-10s | What viewer will learn/gain |
| Stack credibility | 10-20s | Prove you earned this insight |
| Bridge to application | 20-25s | Connect to video body |

**Target length:** 15-25s MAX

**Philosophy:** Get to value immediately. Pure efficiency. No preamble, no storytime. State what you noticed, promise the explanation, prove you know what you're talking about, move on.

**Best for:** Tactical/strategic content, skeptical viewers, returning audience

**Strengths:** Fastest path to value. Respects viewer time. Works on any topic. Hardest to mess up.

**Weaknesses:** Less emotional connection. Can feel transactional. Not ideal for vulnerability content.

**Example structure:**
> "Most people using [tool] are doing [specific thing wrong]. There's a [better approach] that [specific result]. I've [credibility statement]. Here's [bridge]."

---

### Template A: Shared Struggle -> Contrarian Insight

**Use 1-2x per 10 videos. MINDSET CONTENT ONLY.**

| Element | Timing | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Universal truth | 0-10s | Shared experience everyone recognizes |
| Show you still experience it | 10-20s | Vulnerability, not past tense |
| Normalize it | 20-30s | "This is human, not failure" |
| Reframe as skill | 30-40s | The contrarian flip |
| Promise | 40-50s | What they'll walk away with |

**Target length:** 35-50s

**Philosophy:** Build trust through vulnerability, then teach. Viewer feels seen before they feel taught. Only works when the vulnerability is genuine and current (not "I used to struggle").

**Best for:** Mindset/permission content. Imposter syndrome topics. "You're not broken" messages.

**Strengths:** Deep emotional connection. High comment rate ("I felt this"). Builds parasocial trust fast.

**Weaknesses:** Easy to overuse (becomes a crutch). Long. Doesn't work for tactical content. Can feel manipulative if forced.

**Example structure:**
> "[Universal experience everyone has]. [Admit you had it recently - specific moment]. [Normalize: most people feel this]. [Reframe: it's actually a signal of X]. [Promise what video delivers]."

---

### Template B: Myth-Busting with Stakes

**SECONDARY WORKHORSE. Use 2-3x per 10 videos.**

| Element | Timing | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| State wrong belief | 0-5s | What most people think (and do) |
| Why wrong + truth | 5-15s | The correction with evidence |
| Credibility | 15-20s | Why you know this |
| Promise | 20-25s | What viewer gains from the correction |

**Target length:** 20-30s

**Philosophy:** Challenge a wrong belief, prove you know better. The "wrong belief" must be something the viewer currently holds or has heard repeatedly. If it's not genuinely believed, the myth-bust falls flat.

**Best for:** "You're doing X wrong" content. Counter-narrative videos. Anything where conventional wisdom is demonstrably incorrect.

**Strengths:** Immediate tension. Strong pattern interrupt. Positions you as the knowledgeable contrarian.

**Weaknesses:** Can come off arrogant if credibility isn't earned. Myth must be real (not a strawman). Overuse makes you "the guy who disagrees with everything."

**Example structure:**
> "[Common advice everyone gives]. [Why it's wrong - specific reason]. I [credibility]. [What actually works and what they'll learn]."

---

### Template C: Pain Point Diagnosis

**Use 1-2x per 10 videos.**

| Element | Timing | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Describe exact pain | 0-10s | So specific they think you're watching them |
| Recent experience | 10-15s | You felt this too, recently |
| Surface solutions fail | 15-25s | Why the obvious fixes don't work |
| Tease real reasons | 25-35s | The deeper cause (don't reveal yet) |

**Target length:** 30-40s

**Philosophy:** Describe pain SO specifically the viewer thinks you're reading their mind. The specificity IS the hook. Vague pain ("struggling with growth") doesn't work. Exact pain ("you published 3 videos, got 47 views each, and now you're wondering if the algorithm hates you") does.

**Best for:** Diagnostic/troubleshooting content. "Why X isn't working" videos. Audience who tried and failed.

**Strengths:** Extremely high "this is literally me" response. Strong emotional hook. Great comment bait.

**Weaknesses:** Requires knowing your audience's exact pain (not guessing). Longer format. Can feel manipulative if the diagnosis is superficial.

**Example structure:**
> "[Describe their exact situation with specific details]. [You experienced this - when]. [What they tried that didn't work]. [There are deeper reasons - and that's what this video covers]."

---

### Template D: Proof-First Evidence

**Use 1-2x per 10 videos.**

| Element | Timing | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Show result | 0-5s | The receipt, the screenshot, the number |
| Context | 5-10s | What this means, why it matters |
| Why it matters | 10-20s | The implication for the viewer |
| Promise how | 20-25s | They can do this too |

**Target length:** 20-30s

**Philosophy:** Show receipts first, explain second. Lead with the proof because proof is inarguable. Works best when the proof is visual (screenshot, dashboard, result) or numerical (specific dollar amount, percentage, timeframe).

**Best for:** Case study videos. Results-driven content. "How I did X" videos where X is impressive.

**Strengths:** Instantly credible. Hard to dismiss. Appeals to skeptics.

**Weaknesses:** Requires having actual proof. Can feel braggy without proper framing. Doesn't work for mindset content.

**Example structure:**
> "[Specific result - number, screenshot, outcome]. [Context: what this was, timeline]. [Why this matters to viewer]. [How they'll learn to do this]."

---

### Template E: Quick Credibility -> Promise

**WEAKEST TEMPLATE. Use 0-1x per 10 videos. Avoid when possible.**

| Element | Timing | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Specific credibility | 0-5s | One sharp credential |
| Contrast start | 5-10s | Where you began vs now |
| Direct promise | 10-20s | Exactly what viewer gets |

**Target length:** 15-25s

**Philosophy:** Establish authority fast. Lean on track record. This is the weakest template because it leads with "me" not "you." Only use when the credibility is genuinely impressive AND directly relevant to the topic.

**Best for:** When your specific experience is the reason someone should watch. Authority-dependent topics.

**Strengths:** Fast. Clear positioning. Works if credential is genuinely rare.

**Weaknesses:** Self-centered opening. Viewers haven't earned caring about you yet. Feels like every other YouTube guru intro. Easy to sound braggy.

**Example structure:**
> "[Specific credential relevant to topic]. [Where you started]. [Direct promise of what viewer will learn]."

---

## 3. Template Selection Decision Tree

```
Is this strategy or tactical content?
  YES -> Template F (Observation -> Promise -> Proof)

Is there a clear, commonly-held myth to bust?
  YES -> Template B (Myth-Busting with Stakes)

Is this pure mindset or permission content?
  YES -> Template A (Shared Struggle -> Contrarian Insight)
         Keep it TIGHT. Vulnerability is not an excuse for length.

Is this diagnostic or troubleshooting?
  YES -> Template C (Pain Point Diagnosis)

Do you have compelling visual proof or specific numbers?
  YES -> Template D (Proof-First Evidence)

Everything else?
  -> Template F (when in doubt, efficiency wins)
```

**Rotation tracking:** Never use the same template 3x in a row across videos. Track what was used in the last 5 videos and force variety.

---

## 4. Required Inputs

Before generating any hook, collect:

| Input | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Locked title | YES | Hook must confirm the title's promise |
| Thumbnail description | YES | Hook must confirm the thumbnail's visual promise |
| Video type | YES | Strategy / Mindset / Tactical / Analysis / Case Study |
| Core promise | YES | The single thing the viewer walks away with |
| Key contrarian insight | YES | What makes this video's take different |
| Recent personal example | NO | Adds authenticity if available |
| Specific numbers | NO | Adds credibility if available |
| Student/client result | NO | Social proof if available |

If title or thumbnail is missing, do not generate hooks. Ask for them first.

---

## 5. Pre-Generation Analysis

**Complete ALL 5 steps BEFORE writing any hook text.**

### Step 1: Video Context Analysis
- What makes THIS video different from 100 others on the same topic?
- What is the viewer's state of mind when they click? (Curious? Frustrated? Skeptical?)
- What did the thumbnail promise visually?

### Step 2: Pattern Avoidance
- What templates were used in the last 3-5 videos?
- What opening phrases were used recently? BAN them.
- What story types were used recently? BAN them.

### Step 3: Fresh Angle Identification
- Can the structure be flipped? (Start where you'd normally end)
- Can the POV change? (Second person instead of first? "You" before "I"?)
- Can the length be dramatically different from recent hooks?

### Step 4: Template Justification
- For each of the 3 options, state WHY this template fits THIS video
- If defaulting to Template F, confirm no other template is clearly better

### Step 5: Efficiency Target
- Set a target length BEFORE writing
- Strategy/Tactical: aim for 20s
- Mindset: aim for 35s
- Diagnostic: aim for 30s
- If the hook exceeds target by >10s, compress or pick a different template

---

## 6. Credibility Weaving Strategies

Three ways to establish credibility. Pick ONE per hook.

| Strategy | Placement | Pattern | Best When |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Upfront | 0-5s | "I [action] and [result] in [timeframe]" | Credential is directly relevant and impressive |
| Woven Relatability | 10-20s in | "[Timeframe], I [same struggle]" | Building empathy first, then earning authority |
| Earned | After value | "...which is how I [result]" | The insight itself is the credential |

**Rules:**
- Never stack all three. One per hook.
- "Upfront" is the weakest because it leads with "me"
- "Earned" is the strongest because the viewer respects you before you claim authority
- "Woven Relatability" is the safest balance

---

## 7. Transition Types

How to move between hook sections.

| Type | Pattern | Examples | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| Problem -> Insight | Pivot from what's wrong to what's true | "But..." / "Turns out..." / "The reality is..." | Template B, Template F |
| Setup -> Promise | Move from context to what video delivers | "So in this video..." / "Here's what I'm going to show you..." | Template D, Template E |
| Empathy -> Solution | Move from shared pain to what fixes it | "I get it. But..." / "Look, I've been there. And..." | Template A, Template C |

**Rules:**
- One transition per hook (two max for longer hooks)
- The transition is where retention dips or holds. Make it tight.
- "But" is the strongest single-word transition. Don't overuse it.

---

## 8. Promise Structures

How to tell the viewer what they'll get.

| Style | Pattern | Best For |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Specific Outcome | "By the end, you'll [capability]" | Tactical content, clear deliverable |
| Roadmap with Intrigue | "[element 1], [element 2], [surprising element 3]" | Multi-section videos, listicles |
| Problem -> Solution | "what's causing this and how to fix it" | Diagnostic content |
| No Explicit Roadmap | Let promise emerge naturally from the hook | Short hooks, Template F, when roadmap feels forced |

**Rules:**
- Not every hook needs an explicit promise/roadmap
- "Roadmap with Intrigue" works best when element 3 is genuinely unexpected
- "Specific Outcome" is the clearest but can feel formulaic
- When in doubt, skip the explicit roadmap. If the hook works, the promise is implicit.

---

## 9. Length Calibration

| Video Type | Target | Absolute Max |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Strategy/Tactical | 15-25s | 30s |
| Mindset/Permission | 25-40s | 50s |
| Diagnostic | 25-35s | 40s |
| Pure vulnerability (Template A only) | 35-50s | 50s |
| Proof-First | 20-30s | 30s |

**Compression test:** Remove one sentence. Does the hook still work? If yes, keep it cut. Repeat until removing a sentence breaks the hook.

**Length bias:** When two versions are equally good, pick the shorter one. Always.

---

## 10. Voice Authenticity Rules

### Required (every hook)

- Contractions everywhere ("I've" not "I have", "don't" not "do not")
- Natural connectors: So / Right / Look / And / Now
- Conversational fragments (incomplete sentences that sound like speech)
- Tone: friend giving advice over coffee, not presenter on stage

### Forbidden AI Tells

These phrases IMMEDIATELY mark writing as AI-generated. Never use them:

| Phrase | Why It's Bad |
|--------|-------------|
| "I'll let you in on a secret" | Cliche opener, zero information |
| "Here's the critical part" | Filler, says nothing |
| "At the end of the day" | Dead phrase, adds nothing |
| "Something magical happens" | Vague hype |
| "What if I told you..." | Matrix meme, overused |
| "Let me break this down for you" | Patronizing |
| "Moving forward" | Corporate speak |
| "Game-changer" | Meaningless hype |
| "The bottom line is" | Stalling before the point |
| "Remember -" | Preachy, assumes forgetting |

### The Question/Fragment Ban

**NEVER use:**
- Rhetorical questions ("Want to know why?" / "Sound familiar?")
- Question fragments ("The key?" / "The difference?" / "The problem?")
- Subject fragments used as dramatic pauses

**Instead:** Use direct statements. "The key is X" not "The key? X." -- "Here's why" not "Want to know why?"

Rhetorical questions feel like a YouTube cliche from 2019. Direct statements feel confident.

---

## 11. Script Review Checkpoint

After writing the hook, check against the full script.

### FORBIDDEN
- Copying phrases from the script body (word-for-word overlap)
- Using the same examples that appear in Block 1 of the script
- Repeating analogies or metaphors the script uses later
- "Teasing" content that is said word-for-word later (viewer will notice the repeat)

### ALLOWED
- Referencing the TOPIC without spoiling the specific insight
- Creating NEW vulnerability moments not in the script
- Setting up problems the script will solve (without giving the solution)

### Litmus Test
Read the hook, then read the first 2 minutes of script. Would a viewer say "wait, didn't he just say this?" If YES, rewrite the hook.

---

## 12. Efficiency Check

Run through this checklist before finalizing any hook option.

- [ ] Could this be cut to under 25s without losing impact?
- [ ] Am I telling a story because it's ESSENTIAL or because it feels safer than getting to the point?
- [ ] Does every sentence directly pay off the title/thumbnail promise?
- [ ] Is credibility stacked efficiently (one proof point, not three)?
- [ ] Am I using vulnerability as a crutch to fill time?
- [ ] Is there a single sentence that could be removed? Remove it.

If more than one checkbox fails, the hook needs rewriting, not editing.

---

## 13. Output Format

**ALWAYS present exactly 3 options. NEVER pick a winner.**

### Option 1: Safe
- Proven template, typically Template F or B
- 15-25s target
- Lower risk, reliable engagement
- When this works: most of the time

### Option 2: Experimental
- Unexpected angle, atypical template for this content type
- 25-40s target
- Higher risk, higher reward if it lands
- When this works: when the audience is warmed up or the topic has high emotional charge

### Option 3: Hybrid
- Combines elements from 2+ templates
- 20-35s target
- Balanced risk/reward
- When this works: when no single template perfectly fits

**For each option, include:**

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Template used | Which template(s) and why |
| Full hook text | The complete spoken text, ready to read aloud |
| Estimated timing | Total seconds, broken by section |
| WHY THIS WORKS | 2-3 sentences on the psychological mechanism |
| Originality notes | What's fresh vs recent hooks |
| Efficiency justification | Why it's this length and not shorter |

**NEVER recommend one option over another.** Present all 3, let the creator decide.

---

## 14. Final Decision Rules

When two approaches seem equal, these rules break the tie:

1. Vulnerability over authority
2. Specificity over generality
3. Recent struggle over distant success
4. Natural voice over "optimized" copy
5. NEW stories over repeating script content
6. Statements over rhetorical questions
7. Template F over everything else (when in doubt)
8. Shorter over longer
9. Fresh structure over familiar patterns
10. "You" before "I" (viewer-first framing)

These are tiebreakers, not absolutes. Context always wins over rules.
