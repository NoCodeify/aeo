# 2026 Content Calendar

> **Updated Feb 16, 2026.** Channel pivoted from AEO to Claude Code. W2-W8 are legacy AEO content. W09+ targets Claude Code keywords.

**Strategy:** Search-first. Every video targets a keyword people are actually searching on YouTube. Data sourced from Google Trends (YouTube), Google Ads keyword data, and rising query analysis.

**Content positioning:** Production case studies and intermediate content (NOT beginner tutorials - that space is saturated by Nick Saraev, Anthropic docs, Udemy). Our angle is "what I actually built" and "how it works in production."

**CTA:** YouTube = awareness (what's possible). Claudify ($97/mo Skool) = execution (build it together).

## Claude Code Content (W09+) - Search-First Strategy

### Week 9 (Feb 16-22)
**Target Keyword:** "claude code use cases" (+65,150% YouTube growth)
**Title:** "Claude Code Use Cases: 5 Things I Actually Built"
**Thumbnail:** "5 REAL BUILDS" + hub-and-satellite glossy icons on black
**1+1=3:** Title = keyword + listicle, Thumbnail = proof (real builds, not hypothetical)
**Angle:** Personal case studies: DM Champ, AEO auditor, video editor, email system, lead gen. Show what's actually running in production.
**Status:** In production (7:50 clean, timeline built, previewing)

---

### Week 10 (Feb 23 - Mar 1)
**Target Keyword:** "claude code teams" (+39,900 YouTube rising, also "claude code agent teams" +39,850)
**Volume:** Rising fast, 500K parent term ("claude code")
**Title:** "Claude Code Teams: How to Build Multi-Agent Systems"
**Thumbnail:** "AGENT ARMY" + 5 interconnected glossy bot icons in formation on black
**1+1=3:** Title = tutorial keyword, Thumbnail = scale/power visual
**Angle:** Show how agent teams work in practice. Lead agent delegates to specialists. Real example: the video production pipeline (timeline + slides + GIFs in parallel). Contrast with single-agent limitations.
**Script length:** ~2,170 words (10 min target)

---

### Week 11 (Mar 2-8)
**Target Keyword:** "vibe coding" (500K/mo, +999,900% YoY)

**Thumbnail:** "NOT WHAT YOU THINK" + broken code icon vs polished app icon on black
**1+1=3:** Title = contrarian take on massive keyword, Thumbnail = expectation vs reality
**Angle:** Most vibe coding content is "look I built a todo app." Reality: 63% of users are non-developers, most projects die at deployment. Show what vibe coding actually looks like for production apps. The good, bad, and what nobody talks about.
**Script length:** ~2,600 words (12 min target, topic has depth)

---

**Thumbnail:** "FULL SETUP" + terminal icon with checkmark on black
**1+1=3:** Title = definitive keyword, Thumbnail = completion/confidence
