# Thumbnail Validation Rules

Operational reference for generating and validating YouTube thumbnails. Every thumbnail concept MUST pass these checks before being presented to the user.

---

## 1. Title-Thumbnail Synergy Rule

Title and thumbnail are a TEAM. They must complement, not duplicate.

| Element | Job | Delivers |
|---------|-----|----------|
| **Title** | WHEN + WHY | Acute moment + urgency |
| **Thumbnail** | WHAT + EMOTION | Visual + feeling |

### The Golden Rule: REINFORCE, Never REPEAT

The thumbnail must add NEW information the title does not contain. If the thumbnail visually re-explains the title, it fails.

| Title | Bad Thumbnail | Good Thumbnail |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| "7 Claude Code Features Most Devs Miss" | Text says "7 FEATURES" with checkboxes | Text says "YOU'RE MISSING THIS" with shocked expression |
| "Cursor vs Claude Code: Which Ships Faster?" | Side-by-side logos with "VS" | "10X FASTER" with speed blur effect |
| "I Built 5 Real Products With Claude Code" | Text says "5 PRODUCTS" with list icons | "ALL REAL" with glossy app icons fanning out |

### Quick Test

Ask: "Does the thumbnail ADD something the title doesn't say?"

- YES = good synergy (thumbnail reinforces)
- NO = bad synergy (thumbnail repeats)

---

## 2. Text Selection Framework

### 5 Patterns That Work (all proven 2M+ views)

**Pattern 1: Name the Emotion/Moment**

Text captures a feeling or turning point, not a fact.

Examples: "DON'T QUIT", "THE GAME HAS CHANGED", "IT'S OVER", "FINALLY"

When to use: Survival mode, algorithm shock, major shift videos.

**Pattern 2: Emphasize Timing**

Text anchors to a specific moment in time.

Examples: "AFTER EVERY UPLOAD", "BEFORE/AFTER", "DAY 1 vs DAY 90", "RIGHT NOW"

When to use: Post-action anxiety, progress validation, time anxiety videos.

**Pattern 3: Contradict Expectations**

Text says something the viewer doesn't expect to hear.

Examples: "NO TALENT", "POST BAD CONTENT", "STOP TRYING", "IT'S NOT CODE"

When to use: Myth-busting, perspective shift, imposter syndrome videos.

**Pattern 4: Simple Comparison**

Text sets up a visual contrast with minimal words.

Examples: "VS", "BEFORE" and "AFTER", "OLD" and "NEW", "WRONG" and "RIGHT"

When to use: Direct comparison, tool evaluation, transformation videos.

**Pattern 5: Direct Outcome Label**

Text states a concrete result or action.

Examples: "VIEWS 362K", "STEAL THIS", "$100K", "SHIPPED IN 3 DAYS"

When to use: Case study, big numbers, specific outcome videos.

### Patterns That Bomb

| Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Explaining process (flowcharts, step icons, checklists) | Thumbnail is not a tutorial slide | Name the OUTCOME instead |
| Vague reassurance ("IT'S ACTUALLY SIMPLE") | No specificity, no tension | Be SPECIFIC about what's simple |
| Generic statements ("LEARN THIS") | Could be any video | Name the emotion or moment |
| Questions as text ("WHICH IS BETTER?") | Passive, doesn't trigger emotion | State a position or outcome |

### Text Length Rule

| Words | Verdict |
|-------|---------|
| 2-4 | Ideal. Maximum impact, instant read |
| 5 | Absolute maximum. Only if every word earns its place |
| 6+ | Too many. Cut ruthlessly |
| 1 | Can work for shock ("WRONG", "DONE") but rarely enough context |

---

## 3. Four Visual Reinforcement Types

Every thumbnail uses ONE primary visual reinforcement type. You can layer a secondary type, but one must dominate.

### TYPE 1: Literal Object

A physical prop or object that represents the outcome or process.

| Example | Object | What It Communicates |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| Video about shipping apps | Glossy app icon | "Real product" |
| Video about speed | Stopwatch or rocket | "Fast" |
| Video about money | Dollar signs, gold coins | "Revenue" |

Best for: Concrete outcomes, product showcases, tool comparisons.

### TYPE 2: Visual Metaphor

A graphic element that symbolizes the concept without being literal.

| Example | Metaphor | What It Communicates |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| Growth trajectory | Arrow pointing up | "Things are improving" |
| Competition | VS graphic, split screen | "Head to head" |
| Before/after | Side-by-side contrast | "Transformation" |

Best for: Comparisons, trends, abstract concepts.

### TYPE 3: Expressive Gesture/Face

The expression or gesture does the heavy emotional lifting.

| Expression | What It Communicates |
|------------|---------------------|
| Serious/intense stare | "This matters" |
| Slight confident smile | "I figured it out" |
| Shrug with raised eyebrows | "It's that easy" |
| Pointing at something | "Look at this" |

Best for: Personal stories, reaction content, opinion pieces.

Note: For our channel, faces are deferred until 2-5K subs (zero recognition at 0 subs). Use TYPE 1 or TYPE 2 as primary until then.

### TYPE 4: Familiar Symbols

Recognizable icons, logos, or symbols that provide instant context.

| Symbol | What It Communicates |
|--------|---------------------|
| Claude Code logo | "This is about Claude Code" |
| GitHub icon | "Code/developer context" |
| Lock icon | "Security or access" |
| Lightning bolt | "Speed or power" |

Best for: Tool-specific content, brand recognition, niche targeting.

### Choosing Your Type

| If your video is about... | Primary type | Secondary type |
|--------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| A specific tool or product | TYPE 4 (logo) | TYPE 1 (object) |
| A personal result or story | TYPE 1 (object showing result) | TYPE 2 (arrow/graph) |
| A comparison | TYPE 2 (VS/contrast) | TYPE 4 (logos) |
| An emotional shift | TYPE 3 (expression) | TYPE 2 (metaphor) |
| A technique or method | TYPE 1 (literal object) | TYPE 4 (symbol) |

---

## 4. Composition Rules

Four proven layouts. Pick one per thumbnail.

### Layout 1: Subject Left, Text Right

```
+---------------------------+
|  [SUBJECT]    [BIG TEXT]  |
|  [object/     [2-4       |
|   icon]        words]    |
+---------------------------+
```

Best for: Product showcases, tool reviews. The eye hits the subject first, then reads the payoff.

### Layout 2: Subject Right, Text Left

```
+---------------------------+
|  [BIG TEXT]    [SUBJECT]  |
|  [2-4          [object/  |
|   words]        icon]    |
+---------------------------+
```

Best for: Outcome-first framing. Text grabs attention, subject confirms context.

### Layout 3: Subject Center, Text Top

```
+---------------------------+
|      [BIG TEXT]           |
|      [2-4 words]          |
|                           |
|      [SUBJECT]            |
|      [centered]           |
+---------------------------+
```

Best for: Hero shots, single dramatic object, bold statements.

### Layout 4: Subject + Object (Interaction)

```
+---------------------------+
|  [SUBJECT] --> [OBJECT]   |
|  [person/      [result/  |
|   tool]         icon]    |
+---------------------------+
```

Best for: Transformation stories, cause-and-effect, before/after.

### Layout Selection Guide

| Video type | Recommended layout |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Case study / build log | Layout 1 or 4 |
| Comparison (A vs B) | Layout 4 |
| Big reveal / result | Layout 3 |
| Tutorial / how-to | Layout 2 |
| Opinion / hot take | Layout 3 |

## 5. Text Styling (Apple Aesthetic)

Our thumbnail style is minimal, clean, and premium. Every element has a purpose.

### Typography

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Font | Porsche font (say "Porsche font" in Imagen prompts) |
| Case | ALL CAPS, always |
| Size | BIGGER than you think. If it feels too big, it's probably right |
| Max words | 2-4 (absolute max 5) |
| Color | White-to-silver gradient (gradual transition, not abrupt) |
| Glow | Soft diffused glow behind text, not harsh outer glow |

### Background and Visual Elements

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Background | Pure black (#000000). No navy, no dark gray, no gradients |
| Icons | Glossy 3D iOS-style app icons |
| Icon glow | Each icon glows its own color (not white, not uniform) |
| Faces | None until 2-5K subscribers |

### What NOT to Do

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Strokes around text | Looks cheap, breaks the clean aesthetic |
| Drop shadows on text | Adds visual noise, reduces readability |
| Outer glows on text | Too heavy. Use soft diffused glow only |
| Navy or dark blue background | Reads as "corporate YouTube" not "premium" |
| Gradient backgrounds | Distracts from the subject. Black is the canvas |
| Multiple font sizes | One size dominates. Hierarchy through placement, not sizing |

### Imagen Prompt Notes

When generating thumbnails via Imagen:

- Say "Porsche font" for the font. Other descriptions ("Futura", "geometric sans-serif") produce inconsistent results
- Generate icons WITHOUT text baked in. Add text manually in Figma/Canva using Syne font
- Imagen-generated text is unreliable for spelling and layout. Always composite text separately
- Specify "pure black background" and "glossy 3D iOS-style app icon with [color] glow"

## 6. Pre-Flight Validation Checklist

Every thumbnail concept must pass ALL four checks before being presented.

### Check 1: Concept

- [ ] Can you visualize it clearly in your head before opening any tool?
- [ ] Text reinforces (not repeats) the title
- [ ] Visual adds context the title does not have
- [ ] You know which expression/gesture to use (or which object replaces it)
- [ ] Can execute in under 1 hour

If any answer is NO, rethink the concept before proceeding.

### Check 2: Text

- [ ] 2-4 words maximum (hard cap: 5)
- [ ] Names an EMOTION or MOMENT (not explains steps or process)
- [ ] Readable at mobile thumbnail size (imagine 160x90 pixels)
- [ ] Uses standard font (Porsche) and colors (white-silver gradient)
- [ ] Does not repeat the title's main keyword verbatim

### Check 3: Visual

- [ ] Chosen ONE primary reinforcement type (Literal Object, Visual Metaphor, Expressive Gesture, Familiar Symbol)
- [ ] If using multiple types, they enhance rather than clutter
- [ ] Main focal point is obvious within 1 second
- [ ] Composition follows one of the four proven layouts
- [ ] Background is pure black with no distracting elements

### Check 4: Simplicity

- [ ] 3-5 elements maximum (text + 1-3 visual elements + background)
- [ ] Not trying to teach or explain anything in the thumbnail
- [ ] If you removed one element, would the thumbnail still communicate?
- [ ] No flowcharts, no checklists, no step numbers, no process diagrams

### The Glance Test

Show the thumbnail for 2 seconds, then hide it. Ask: "What did you see?"

| Response | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Can name the text AND the visual | PASS |
| Can name one but not both | Needs simplification |
| "I saw a lot of stuff" | FAIL. Too cluttered |
| "I'm not sure" | FAIL. No focal point |

If you can't articulate what you saw in 2 seconds, simplify until you can.

## 7. Common Mistakes and Fixes

### Mistake 1: Explaining Process

**Problem:** Thumbnail shows a flowchart, numbered steps, or checklist icons. This is a tutorial slide, not a thumbnail.

**Fix:** Name the OUTCOME or EMOTION instead. "3 STEPS TO SHIP" becomes "SHIPPED IT" with a glossy app icon.

### Mistake 2: Too Clever or Abstract

**Problem:** Metaphor requires explanation. Viewer spends cognitive effort decoding instead of clicking.

**Fix:** Go OBVIOUS over CLEVER. If you need to explain why the visual makes sense, it doesn't work at thumbnail scale. A rocket is obvious. A Mobius strip representing "infinite iteration" is not.

### Mistake 3: Generic Reassurance

**Problem:** Text like "IT WORKS", "TRUST THE PROCESS", "YOU CAN DO IT". No specificity, no tension.

**Fix:** Be SPECIFIC. "IT WORKS" becomes "$8.3K/MO". "TRUST THE PROCESS" becomes "DAY 1 vs DAY 90". Specificity creates curiosity.

### Mistake 4: Text Overload

**Problem:** 6+ words crammed into the thumbnail. Unreadable at mobile size. Brain gives up before processing.

**Fix:** Cut to 2-4 words MAX. Read each word and ask: "Does this word earn its space?" If removing it doesn't change the meaning, remove it.

### Mistake 5: Missing Emotion

**Problem:** Thumbnail is informational but flat. No tension, no curiosity, no feeling.

**Fix:** Add emotion through ONE of these channels:
- **Text:** Use emotional words ("DON'T", "FINALLY", "WRONG")
- **Expression:** A face that shows how the viewer should feel (deferred until 2-5K subs)
- **Visual:** Color, contrast, or composition that creates tension (red vs green, small vs large, broken vs whole)

### Mistake 6: Title-Thumbnail Repetition

**Problem:** Title says "5 Things I Built" and thumbnail says "5 BUILDS" with five icons.

**Fix:** Thumbnail should answer a DIFFERENT question. Title tells you WHAT the video is. Thumbnail tells you HOW IT FEELS or WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. "5 Things I Built" + "ALL REAL" (with one hero app icon) = synergy.

### Mistake 7: Wrong Reinforcement Type

**Problem:** Using a visual metaphor when a literal object would be clearer, or vice versa.

**Fix:** Match the reinforcement type to the video content:
- Concrete result? Use TYPE 1 (Literal Object)
- Abstract concept? Use TYPE 2 (Visual Metaphor)
- Personal story? Use TYPE 3 (Expression) or TYPE 1
- Tool-specific? Use TYPE 4 (Familiar Symbol)

## 8. Options-First Output Format

When presenting thumbnail concepts, NEVER pick a winner. Present 3+ options and let the user choose.

### Format for Each Option

```
### Option [N]: "[THUMBNAIL TEXT]"

- **Text:** [2-4 words, ALL CAPS]
- **Visual reinforcement:** [TYPE 1/2/3/4] -- [brief description]
- **Composition:** [Layout 1/2/3/4] -- [brief description]
- **Pattern:** [Which of the 5 text patterns from Section 2]
- **Title synergy:** [What the thumbnail ADDS that the title doesn't say]
- **Pre-flight score:** [X/4 checks passed]
- **Glance test prediction:** "Viewer sees ___"
```

### Example

For the title: "7 Claude Code Features Most Developers Miss"

```
### Option 1: "YOU'RE MISSING THIS"

- **Text:** YOU'RE MISSING THIS (3 words)
- **Visual reinforcement:** TYPE 4 (Familiar Symbol) -- Claude Code logo with magnifying glass icon, red glow
- **Composition:** Layout 2 -- Text left, logo right
- **Pattern:** Pattern 1 (Name the Emotion/Moment) -- FOMO/anxiety
- **Title synergy:** Title says WHAT (features). Thumbnail says HOW IT FEELS (you're behind)
- **Pre-flight score:** 4/4
- **Glance test prediction:** "Viewer sees urgent text and the Claude logo"

### Option 2: "HIDDEN"

- **Text:** HIDDEN (1 word)
- **Visual reinforcement:** TYPE 1 (Literal Object) -- 7 glossy app icons, 5 dimmed, 2 glowing bright
- **Composition:** Layout 3 -- Text top center, icons clustered below
- **Pattern:** Pattern 1 (Name the Emotion/Moment) -- mystery/discovery
- **Title synergy:** Title says HOW MANY (7). Thumbnail says THEY'RE HIDDEN (visual scarcity)
- **Pre-flight score:** 4/4
- **Glance test prediction:** "Viewer sees 'HIDDEN' and some bright icons among dim ones"

### Option 3: "NOT THESE"

- **Text:** NOT THESE (2 words)
- **Visual reinforcement:** TYPE 2 (Visual Metaphor) -- Red X marks over common feature icons, one green checkmark
- **Composition:** Layout 1 -- X'd icons left, green check right
- **Pattern:** Pattern 3 (Contradict Expectations) -- challenges assumption
- **Title synergy:** Title says developers MISS features. Thumbnail says they're focused on the WRONG ones
- **Pre-flight score:** 4/4
- **Glance test prediction:** "Viewer sees red X's and one green check"
```

### Rules for Presenting Options

1. Always present at least 3 options
2. Vary the text patterns across options (don't use Pattern 1 three times)
3. Vary the visual reinforcement types (don't use TYPE 4 three times)
4. Vary the composition layouts when possible
5. Include the title synergy explanation for every option
6. NEVER say "I recommend" or "The best option is"
7. Let the user pick, then refine based on their choice

---

## 9. Thumbnail-to-Imagen Workflow

After the user picks a concept, translate it to an Imagen prompt.

### Step 1: Generate Icons/Visuals (WITHOUT Text)

```
Prompt structure:
"[Description of visual elements], glossy 3D iOS-style app icon,
[color] glow, pure black background, minimal composition,
premium Apple aesthetic, no text"
```

Generate 3 variations. Let the user pick the best visual.

### Step 2: Add Text in Figma/Canva

- Font: Syne (closest to "Porsche font" available in design tools)
- Weight: Bold or ExtraBold
- Case: ALL CAPS
- Color: White with subtle gradient to silver (top to bottom)
- Glow: Soft white outer glow, 20-30% opacity, large blur radius
- Placement: Per the chosen composition layout

### Step 3: Mobile Size Test

Shrink to 160x90 pixels. Can you still read the text and identify the visual? If not, make text bigger or simplify the visual.

## Quick Reference Card

```
TEXT PATTERNS (pick one):
  1. Name emotion/moment   ("DON'T QUIT", "FINALLY")
  2. Emphasize timing      ("AFTER", "BEFORE/AFTER")
  3. Contradict expected   ("NO TALENT", "STOP TRYING")
  4. Simple comparison     ("VS", "OLD vs NEW")
  5. Direct outcome        ("$100K", "SHIPPED")

VISUAL TYPES (pick one primary):
  1. Literal Object        (prop representing outcome)
  2. Visual Metaphor       (graph, arrow, VS graphic)
  3. Expressive Gesture    (face/expression, deferred until 2-5K subs)
  4. Familiar Symbol       (logos, recognizable icons)

SYNERGY RULE:
  Title  = WHEN + WHY
  Thumb  = WHAT + EMOTION
  Test   = "Does thumb ADD info title doesn't have?"

PRE-FLIGHT (all must pass):
  [ ] Concept: clear in head, reinforces not repeats
  [ ] Text: 2-4 words, emotion/moment, mobile-readable
  [ ] Visual: one primary type, clear focal point, proven layout
  [ ] Simplicity: 3-5 elements, no teaching, passes glance test

OUTPUT RULES:
  [ ] 3+ options minimum
  [ ] Vary patterns, types, and layouts across options
  [ ] Include synergy explanation for each
  [ ] NEVER pick winner for user
```
