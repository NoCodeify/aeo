## ✅ WHAT ALWAYS WORKS (Proven High Scorers)

- **Lists** (5, 10, 12 items) + Time-specific detail
- **Time-based goals** (7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 1 year)
- **Specific metrics** (99%, $10K/month, 100K subscribers)
- **Direct audience call-out** ("If you're X...")
- **Problem + cost** ("Costs millions," "Wastes hours")
- **Authority positioning** (Expert, Engineer, CEO explains)
- **Contradiction** (Simple vs. complex; lazy vs. productive)
- **Emotional triggers** (Regret, shame, FOMO, desire)
- **Current year/trend marker** ("In 2026," "Before 2025")

---

## ❌ WHAT NEVER WORKS

- Generic educational titles ("Tutorial," "How-to," "Guide")
- No specific audience identification
- Vague benefit ("This will change your life" without specifics)
- No time/urgency element
- No problem framing
- Pure feature listing
- No emotional hook
- Missing specificity (too broad)

## 🎬 FOR CLAUDE CODE / TECH CONTENT SPECIFICALLY

### ✅ DO THIS:
1. **Lead with problem**: "Why 99% of Agent Systems Fail"
2. **Use numbers/metrics**: Hook scores 2,000+ correlate with metrics
3. **Specific audience**: "If You're New to Claude Code..."
4. **Time constraint**: "7 Days," "2 Weeks," "30 Days"
5. **Authority credibility**: "Engineer Explains," "Creator Built"
6. **Contradiction angle**: "Simpler = Better," "Less Code = Faster"
7. **Emotional stakes**: Regret, missed opportunity, learning value

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS:
- "Claude Code Tutorial" (too vague)
- "Learn Agents" (no hook)
- "AI Development Guide" (boring, generic)
- "How to Use Claude Code" (no benefit)
- "Tips for Building Agents" (no urgency)
- "Agent Architecture Basics" (no desire)

### 💡 ADAPT FROM HIGH-SCORERS:
Instead of: "How to Build an Agent"
Try: "I Built 5 Production Agents in 30 Days. Here's the Pattern."
**Score uplift**: 300 → 2,500+

Instead of: "Understanding Multi-Agent Systems"
Try: "Why Most Multi-Agent Systems Fail (And How to Fix It)"
**Score uplift**: 400 → 2,000+

Instead of: "Claude Code Best Practices"
Try: "The ONE Agent Pattern That Scales (I Tested It at Production)"
**Score uplift**: 350 → 2,000+
