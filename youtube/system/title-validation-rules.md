# YouTube Title Validation Rules

Operational reference for generating and validating YouTube titles. Every title candidate MUST pass these checks before being presented to the user.

---

## 1. Core Philosophy

**One Core Question:** "What just happened to this person that makes them need this RIGHT NOW?"

Every title must target a viewer at a **specific acute moment** -- not a general interest.

### Acute vs Chronic Pain

| Type | Definition | Example | Clicks? |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Acute** | Specific triggering event happening NOW | "I just deployed and it broke production" | Yes |
| **Chronic** | Ongoing background problem | "I want to be a better developer" | No |

Acute = clicks. Chronic = scrolls past.

### Three Critical Questions (all must be YES)

1. **Do viewers know what this means?** No jargon, no insider terms, no ambiguity.
2. **Why does it matter to them?** Clear stakes or outcome they care about.
3. **Does it solve their problem?** Promises a specific resolution, not vague "value."

### Biggest Leverage Point

Packaging > Content. A great video with a bad title gets zero views. A mediocre video with a great title gets clicks (and then retention matters). Title is the single highest-ROI element.

## 2. 10 Proven Acute Moment Categories

These are ARCHETYPES. Adapt to YOUR niche (Claude Code / AI / vibe coding / developer tools).

| # | Acute Moment | Trigger | Claude Code Niche Example |
|---|-------------|---------|---------------------------|
| 1 | **POST-ACTION ANXIETY** | "I just did X, now what?" | "I installed Claude Code, now what?" |
| 2 | **BEST WORK FLOPPING** | "My best effort got terrible results" | "My agent keeps failing on real codebases" |
| 3 | **SURVIVAL / QUIT MODE** | "This is too hard, should I give up?" | "AI coding tools are overwhelming" |
| 4 | **ALGORITHM / TREND FOMO** | "Did something change? Am I behind?" | "Everyone's using Claude Code and I'm not" |
| 5 | **VALIDATION NEED** | "Is this normal? Am I the only one?" | "Is it normal that AI writes 80% of my code?" |
| 6 | **DECISION PARALYSIS** | "Torn between two strategies" | "Cursor vs Claude Code -- which one?" |
| 7 | **IMPOSTER SYNDROME** | "I'm not qualified enough for this" | "I'm not a real developer, can I use this?" |
| 8 | **PROGRESS VALIDATION** | "Am I actually getting anywhere?" | "Is vibe coding actually making me faster?" |
| 9 | **TIME ANXIETY** | "I don't want to waste months" | "I don't want to waste weeks learning the wrong tool" |
| 10 | **FUTURE FOMO** | "Am I preparing for what's coming?" | "Will AI replace my coding job?" |

## 3. 16 Proven Title Patterns

| # | Pattern | Structure | Reusable? | Example |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **SPECIFIC TIMING** | "AFTER [Action]..." | REPEATABLE | "AFTER Installing Claude Code, Do This First" |
| 2 | **SPECIFIC IDENTITY** | "[Identity] + [Outcome]" | REPEATABLE | "Non-Technical Founders Are Building Apps With This" |
| 3 | **SPECIFIC OUTCOME** | Concrete result, not vague | REPEATABLE | "Ship 10x Faster" not "improve productivity" |
| 4 | **NUMBERS** | "[N] Things/Ways/Steps" | REPEATABLE | "7 Claude Code Features Most People Miss" |
| 5 | **EXPLAINS WHY** | "Why Your [Thing]..." | ONE-TIME | "Why Your AI Agents Keep Breaking" |
| 6 | **TIME TRADE OFFER** | "[Long Time]...[Short Time]" | ONE-TIME per format | "1,158 Hours of Claude Code in 12 Minutes" |
| 7 | **DIRECT COMPARISON** | "[A] vs [B]: Which [Outcome]" | REPEATABLE | "Cursor vs Claude Code: Which Ships Faster?" |
| 8 | **SIGNS/INDICATORS** | "[N] Signs You [State]" | REPEATABLE | "5 Signs You're Using Claude Code Wrong" |
| 9 | **PERSPECTIVE SHIFT** | "[Thing] Isn't [Belief]. It's [Reality]" | REPEATABLE | "Vibe Coding Isn't Lazy. It's Leverage." |
| 10 | **IDENTITY CONTRAST** | "How [Identity] Are [Outcome]" | REPEATABLE | "How Solo Founders Are Replacing Dev Teams" |
| 11 | **PHASE-SPECIFIC** | "[Phase] + [Topic]" | REPEATABLE | "Your First Week With Claude Code" |
| 12 | **MYTH-BUSTING** | "Until You Know This" | REPEATABLE | "Stop Prompting Claude Code Until You Know This" |
| 13 | **STUDY-BASED AUTHORITY** | "I [Studied/Built/Tested] [N]+ [Things]" | ONE-TIME per number | "I Built 5 Real Products With Claude Code" |
| 14 | **HONEST TIMELINES** | "[Timeframe] Blueprint/Roadmap" | REPEATABLE | "90-Day Claude Code Blueprint for Non-Devs" |
| 15 | **FORMULA/SYSTEM** | "I made a formula/system" | REPEATABLE with caution | "My System for Shipping Apps in Days" |
| 16 | **COMPARATIVE LEARNING** | "Study these [things] instead" | REPEATABLE | "Study These 3 Claude Code Projects Instead" |

### Reuse Rules

- **REPEATABLE**: Can use across multiple videos, vary the specifics.
- **ONE-TIME**: Loses impact if repeated. Use once, then retire the exact format.
- **ONE-TIME per format/number**: Can reuse with a DIFFERENT number or framing.

## 4. Master Title Formula

```
[SPECIFIC IDENTITY] + [ACUTE MOMENT / TIMING] + [SPECIFIC OUTCOME]
```

Examples applying the formula:

| Identity | Acute Moment | Outcome | Title |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Solo founders | Post-install anxiety | Ship first app | "Solo Founders: Do This AFTER Installing Claude Code" |
| Non-technical people | Future FOMO | Build without devs | "How Non-Technical Founders Are Shipping Real Apps" |
| Developers | Decision paralysis | Pick the right tool | "Cursor vs Claude Code: Which Actually Ships Faster?" |

Not every title needs all three elements. Two out of three is acceptable if the title is under 65 characters and passes all checks.

---

## 5. Red Flags

STOP and rewrite if ANY of these are true:

| Red Flag | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------------|
| Uses "ACTUALLY" with vague outcomes | "What actually works" = empty promise |
| Promises "system/workflow/process" as the MAIN hook without a specific outcome | Process words are not outcomes |
| Over 70 characters | Gets truncated on mobile, loses impact |
| No specific number, timing, or identity marker | Too generic, could be anyone's video |
| Cannot identify the SPECIFIC MOMENT the viewer is in | Not targeting acute pain |
| Title could apply to anyone at any time | Not specific enough to trigger a click |
| Uses vague outcomes: "grows", "works", "success" alone | No concrete image in the viewer's mind |

---

## 6. Green Flags

Strong titles typically have 3+ of these:

| Green Flag | Why It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| Includes timing words: AFTER, BEFORE, NEW, FIRST, JUST | Places viewer in a specific moment |
| Includes a number (preferably 7-15) | Concrete, scannable, sets expectations |
| Names a specific identity | Viewer self-selects: "that's me" |
| Promises to explain WHY | Curiosity gap -- they need to know the reason |
| Under 65 characters | Full visibility on all devices |
| Creates urgency through specificity | Narrow = more urgent than broad |
| Uses emotional words: MUST, NEVER, Survive, Win, Stop, Secret | Triggers emotional response |

---

## 7. Pre-Flight Validation Checklist

Every title candidate must pass ALL four steps.

### Step 1: Acute Moment Check

- [ ] Can you name the SPECIFIC event that just happened to the viewer?
- [ ] Is this acute (happening now) or chronic (ongoing background)?
- [ ] Would someone experiencing this moment stop scrolling for this title?
- [ ] Is the moment COMMON enough that thousands of people experience it weekly?

If any answer is NO, rewrite before proceeding.

### Step 2: Title Mechanics Check

- [ ] Under 65 characters? (Hard cap: 70)
- [ ] Contains at least ONE of: number, timing word, or identity marker?
- [ ] Outcome is SPECIFIC (not vague like "growth" or "success")?
- [ ] No jargon that a newcomer wouldn't understand?
- [ ] No clickbait that the video can't deliver on?
- [ ] Reads naturally out loud? (No awkward phrasing)

### Step 3: Curiosity Gap Check

- [ ] Can you complete: "They'll click because they want to know ___"?
- [ ] Is the gap specific enough to create tension?
- [ ] Does the video actually answer/resolve the gap?

### Step 4: Final Gut Check

- [ ] Would YOU click this if you saw it in your feed right now?
- [ ] Does it sound DIFFERENT from the last 5 titles on this channel?
- [ ] Could a competing channel use this exact title? (If yes, make it more specific)
- [ ] Is this the BEST version or just the first draft?

---

## 8. Variety Check System

Apply across a SET of title candidates (for a content calendar or batch of options).

### Repetition Rules

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| ANY pattern appears 3+ times in a batch | REJECT extras, replace with different patterns |
| ANY one-time pattern appears 2+ times | REJECT the duplicate |
| 5+ titles use the same opening word(s) | REJECT and vary openers |

### Read-Aloud Test

Read all candidates back-to-back out loud. If they SOUND similar (same rhythm, same structure, same energy), they ARE similar. Rewrite for variety.

### Swap Test

Take any two titles and swap their subjects. If they still work interchangeably, both are too generic. Make each one specific enough that swapping breaks it.

### Red Flags in Batches

- Same opening word on 3+ titles (e.g., "How...", "Why...", "The...")
- Pattern stacking: combining the same 2 patterns repeatedly
- All titles the same length (vary between 40-65 characters)
- All titles the same energy (mix instructional, emotional, provocative)

---

## 9. Options-First Output Format

When presenting title candidates, NEVER pick a winner. Present options in this format:

```
### Option [N]: [Title Text]
- **Characters:** [count]
- **Pattern(s):** [pattern name(s) from Section 3]
- **Acute Moment:** [which moment from Section 2]
- **Green Flags:** [count] -- [list which ones]
- **Red Flags:** [count] -- [list which ones, or "None"]
- **Curiosity Gap:** "They'll click because they want to know ___"
```

Example:

```
### Option 1: 7 Claude Code Features Most Developers Miss
- **Characters:** 47
- **Pattern(s):** NUMBERS (#4), SPECIFIC IDENTITY (#2)
- **Acute Moment:** VALIDATION NEED -- "Am I using this right?"
- **Green Flags:** 4 -- number, identity, under 65 chars, emotional word (miss)
- **Red Flags:** 0 -- None
- **Curiosity Gap:** "They'll click because they want to know which features they're missing"
```

Present 3-5 options minimum. Let the user choose.
