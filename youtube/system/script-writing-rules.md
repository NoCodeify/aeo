# Script Writing Rules

Operational reference for the script-writer agent. Read this file before writing any script.

## Three Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **Anticipation mechanics are sacred** - cannot be "improved away" in the name of voice
2. **Structural beats are load-bearing walls** - can repaint (change words) but cannot remove or move them
3. **"More natural" does NOT always mean better** - architecture intentionally uses patterns that create anticipation

---

## Three Core Mechanics

Every script decision must serve one of these three mechanics.

### Mechanic 1: Orientation (Where Am I?)

| Where | What to do |
|-------|-----------|
| Hook | Set destination + roadmap (2-3 categories, NOT a list of blocks) |
| Block openers | Remind viewer where they are |
| Structural reminders | Every 2-3 minutes, reconnect to main promise |

### Mechanic 2: Anticipation (What's Coming?)

| Element | Cadence |
|---------|---------|
| Forward Pulls | Every 45-60 seconds, tell what's next |
| WHY moments | Create curiosity about implications |

**Pattern:** Tell what's coming -> Make them want it -> Deliver -> Immediately tell what's next

### Mechanic 3: Withholding (Delayed Gratification)

| Phase | % of block | Rule |
|-------|-----------|------|
| SETUP | 30-40% | Present problem, create questions. DON'T hint at solution. |
| TENSION | 40-50% | Show journey to answer. DON'T give action steps yet. |
| PAYOFF | 10-20% | Deliver answer. DON'T over-explain once they get it. |

**DEADLY MISTAKE:** Giving payoff in first 30 seconds of a block.

---

## Forward Pull System

### Hierarchy (Weakest to Strongest)

| Level | Name | Example | Verdict |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Generic Preview | "Next, I'll show you the system" | NEVER USE |
| 2 | Topic Preview | "Next, how to write titles" | NEVER USE |
| 3 | Specific Preview | "why Connor's title is killing his reach" | MINIMUM |
| 4 | Curiosity Gap | "...and it's not what you think" | GOOD |
| 5 | Implied Stakes | "you need to see why they're failing, because if you don't understand this, the tactics won't work" | BEST |

**Minimum standard: Level 3 or higher. Never Level 1-2.**

### Three Types

| Type | Where | Examples |
|------|-------|---------|
| Block Openers | Start of blocks | "So here's the deal..." / "Let's talk about [X]" / Just start with premise |
| Mid-Block | Every 45-60s within blocks | "I'm going to show you..." / "Before I show you how to fix this..." |
| Structural Reminders | Every 2-3 minutes | "That's step one. Step two is where this gets interesting..." |

### BANNED Forward Pull Patterns

- "So that's X. Now let's move to Y..." (signals ending)
- "Now that we've covered X, let's discuss Y..." (too formal)

---

## WHY Moments

### Two Types

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Implication WHY | [Fact]. That means [implication for viewer] | "Only 3% click past page one. That means if you're not there, you don't exist." |
| Causation WHY | [Effect]. This happens because [cause] | "Your reach drops after 48 hours. That's because the algorithm re-scores every video at the 48-hour mark." |

### BANNED WHY Setup Phrases (NEVER use these)

- "And this is why..."
- "And this is critical because..."
- "Here's why this matters..."
- "This is important because..."
- "Here's the thing -"
- "The thing is..."
- "And here's what's happening..."
- "Here's the key insight:"
- "Something magical happens -"

### GOOD WHY Patterns

- "That means [implication]"
- "That's because [reason]"
- "So [consequence]"
- "When you [X], [Y happens]"
- "Which is why [consequence]"
- Just state it directly

### Re-Tension Rule (CRITICAL)

Every WHY moment MUST be followed by new tension within 1-2 sentences.

**Test:** Ask "What's the next question this creates?" Add that before moving on.

---

## Retention Enhancement Techniques

### Pattern 1: Tension Loop (Every 30-60 seconds)

```
Problem [raise]
-> Solution [tease]
-> But here's why harder [deepen]
-> When you do X, Y happens [release]
-> But avoid this next thing [raise again]
```

### Pattern 2: Visual Storytelling Over Abstraction

"This is like [metaphor]. Imagine [visual scene]. When [action happens], [visual result]. That's exactly what happens when [connection to concept]."

### Pattern 3: Strategic Overexplaining

Before every major Payoff, ask: "Do they know WHY this matters?" If not, add ONE sentence.

### Pattern 4: Brain Funnel (Strip Non-Essential)

**"LAND AND MOVE" test:** Find the sentence where the point lands. Everything after it is probably a cut.

### Pattern 5: Credibility Through Vulnerability

```
Struggle (with specifics) -> Turning point -> Discovery -> Authority
```

### Pattern 6: Specificity Over Generality

Never generalize what architecture made specific. Use exact numbers.

### Pattern 7: Expectation Management

"[What we just covered] + [Where we are] + [What's coming and why you should care]"

---

## Setup-Tension-Payoff Execution

### Preferred Teaching Pattern: Problem -> Story -> Action

| Phase | Role | Rule |
|-------|------|------|
| Setup (Problem) | Introduce problem without solving it | No hints at the answer |
| Tension (Story) | Journey, failures, breakthrough | No action steps yet |
| Payoff (Action) | What they should do now | Don't over-explain once it lands |

### Payoff Protection

Before writing a block, identify the answer. If it appears in Setup or Tension, RESTRUCTURE.

### Lists Within Blocks

Still use Setup-Tension-Payoff for EACH item in a list.

**BAD:**
> "First - stop comparing yourself. Here's why..."

**GOOD:**
> "First, there's something most creators do that guarantees they'll quit. [Setup] When you're stuck at 50 views... [Tension] That's why you need to stop comparing. [Payoff]"

---

## Language Rules

### Style

- 5th grade reading level
- Contractions everywhere
- Short punchy sentences
- Write TO them, not AT them

### Question Fragments - ABSOLUTELY BANNED

The `[Subject]? [Answer]` pattern is banned in all forms.

| BANNED | REPLACEMENT |
|--------|-------------|
| "That video? It blew up." | "That video blew up." |
| "The result?" | Just state the result. |
| "[Thing]? [Statement about thing]." | Just make it a statement. |

### Natural Phrases to Use

- "Here's what..."
- "Here's the deal..."
- "So let me show you..."
- "Check this out..."
- "Look at this..."

### Phrases to AVOID

- "Here's the thing -"
- "At the end of the day"
- "The bottom line is"
- "Game-changer"
- "So those are the [X things]..."
- "That's the game"
- "Something magical happens -"

---

## CTA Integration Rules

### Placement

| CTA Type | Placement | Count |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Lead magnet | Early Block 1 + later block before final CTA | 2 mentions required |
| Sponsor (if applicable) | END of Block 1, own STP mini-block | 1 |
| Like request | After first major value delivery | 1 |
| Final CTA | Last block | 1 |

**Minimum 140 words between any two CTAs.**

### Final CTA Structure

| Step | What it does | Example pattern |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Insight | Direct statement about what they've gained | "You now know [X]." |
| Gap | What they still need + why it matters | "But [what they still need]. [Why it matters]." |
| Bridge | Where to go + what they'll get + action | "[Where to go]. [What they'll get]. [Action]." |

### NEVER Signal Ending

- NEVER say "So those are the [X things]..."
- NEVER say "That's the game"
- NEVER use any phrasing that tells the viewer the video is wrapping up

---

## Production Blueprint Format

Every script must include these production elements.

### Dialogue Format

Use `| Visual | What You Say |` tables for all spoken content.

### Production Markers

| Marker | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `LAYOUT:` | Speaker layout (speaker_full, split_right, split_5050, etc.) |
| `SLIDE XX:` | Slide reference for visual |
| `SCREEN XX:` | Screen recording reference |
| `BROLL:` | B-roll description or Pexels search query |
| `GIF:` | GIF description or Giphy search query |
| `SFX:` | Sound effect trigger |
| `TEXT:` | Text overlay content |

### Required Asset Lists

- Screens list (if any screen recordings)
- Slides list with descriptions
- Pexels B-roll queries
- GIF queries
- SFX map (which sounds, where)
- Text overlay list
- Layout flow section for timeline builder

### Word Count

Calculate target duration at 217 WPM baseline.

| Target Duration | Word Count |
|----------------|------------|
| 5 minutes | ~1,085 words |
| 8 minutes | ~1,736 words |
| 10 minutes | ~2,170 words |
| 12 minutes | ~2,604 words |
| 15 minutes | ~3,255 words |

---

## Common "Improvements" That Break Things

| Trap | What sounds right | What it actually does |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| "Too wordy, simplify" | Tighten prose | Separated preview from stakes |
| "Repetitive, cut it" | Remove repeated ideas | Removed WHY moment AND re-tension |
| "Too salesy, soften" | Tone down language | Removed stakes ("might be affecting" vs "costing 80%") |
| "Better flow" | Reorganize for readability | Revealed answer too early |

### When You CAN Improve

- Remove genuine redundancy (saying same thing twice with no structural purpose)
- Fix awkward phrasing while keeping function
- Add natural connectors between beats
- Tighten after point lands (cut belaboring)

---

## Success vs Failure

| | Success | Failure |
|--|---------|---------|
| Voice | Creator reads it and says "this sounds like me" | Creator has to rewrite paragraphs |
| Tone | Conversational, spoken feel | Sounds like a lecture or blog post |
| CTAs | Feel natural, woven into content | Feel jarring, break flow |
| Anticipation | Each block creates anticipation for next | Payoffs given too early |
| Pacing | Forward Pulls every 45-60s throughout | 90+ seconds without a Forward Pull |
| Rewrite needed | Minor tweaks only | Structural rewrite required |
