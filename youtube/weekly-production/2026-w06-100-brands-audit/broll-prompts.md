## BROLL-01: Category Visibility Chart

**Timestamp:** 2:50
**Supports:** "I tested 10 categories. 10 brands each. Here's how they ranked"
**Purpose:** Visualize the stark difference between visible and invisible categories

### Prompt:

Elegant minimal horizontal bar chart showing AI visibility rates across 10 industry categories, arranged as a clean data visualization against a premium dark background. The chart should feel like a McKinsey presentation slide or Apple keynote - sophisticated, readable, and impactful.

BACKGROUND:
Solid deep navy-charcoal gradient (#1e2432 at top transitioning subtly to #171c26 at bottom). NO grid lines, NO texture, NO patterns, NO axis lines. The background should be completely clean and uncluttered, creating a premium data visualization environment. The slight gradient adds depth without distraction.

COMPOSITION:
Horizontal layout with the bar chart occupying approximately 70% of the frame width, centered horizontally. The chart sits in the middle vertical band of the frame (centered at approximately 50% from top). Categories listed on the left, bars extending to the right. Generous padding on all sides - at least 15% margin on left and right edges.

CHART STRUCTURE:
10 horizontal bars stacked vertically with consistent spacing between them. Each bar represents a category's visibility percentage. The bars should be ordered from highest to lowest visibility (top to bottom):

1. Consulting - 80%
2. SaaS - 70%
3. Education - 70%
4. Fintech - 60%
5. DTC - 50%
6. Travel - 50%
7. Agencies - 40%
8. Local Services - 40%
9. Healthcare - 10%
10. Luxury - 10%

BAR DESIGN:
Each bar should be a clean, rounded rectangle with very subtle rounded corners (border-radius approximately 4px). Bar height approximately 28-32px with 16-20px spacing between bars.

Color treatment creates visual hierarchy:
- Top 4 bars (80%, 70%, 70%, 60%): Warm gold (#c9a86c) - these are the "winners"
- Middle 4 bars (50%, 50%, 40%, 40%): Medium silver-gray (#8a8f98) - the middle ground
- Bottom 2 bars (10%, 10%): Darker muted gray (#4a4f58) - the "losers"

This color progression tells the story at a glance - gold = visible, gray = struggling, dark = invisible.

CATEGORY LABELS:
Each category name appears to the left of its bar, right-aligned against an invisible vertical line.
- Font: Clean sans-serif (similar to Inter, SF Pro, or Helvetica Neue)
- Size: 16-18px
- Color: Soft silver-white (#e8eaed)
- Weight: Medium (500)
- Positioned with comfortable spacing from the bar start (approximately 20px gap)

PERCENTAGE LABELS:
Each percentage appears at the right end of its bar (inside the bar for longer bars, outside for short bars).
- Font: Same clean sans-serif
- Size: 14-16px
- Weight: Bold (600)
- Color for gold bars: Dark navy (#1e2432) - inside the bar
- Color for gray/dark bars: Soft silver (#e8eaed) - positioned just outside the bar

For the 10% bars (Healthcare, Luxury), the percentage should appear outside the bar to the right since the bar is too short to contain text.

VISUAL EMPHASIS:
The dramatic drop from 80% to 10% should be immediately readable. The contrast between the long gold bars at top and the tiny dark bars at bottom creates the visual "punch" of the data.

Add a subtle glow behind the top gold bars - warm gold (#c9a86c) at 8-10% opacity with a large feather radius - to draw the eye to the winners.

OPTIONAL DIVIDER:
A very subtle horizontal line (1px, #3a3f48) between the 4th and 5th bars could help separate "visible" from "struggling" categories, but this is optional and should be extremely subtle if included.

TITLE (OPTIONAL):
If space allows, a small title in the upper portion of the frame:
- Text: "AI Visibility by Category"
- Font: Same sans-serif
- Size: 14px
- Color: Medium gray (#8a8f98)
- Position: Upper left, well above the chart

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
The eye should flow naturally from the dominant gold bars at top, progressively seeing the decline, and landing on the shockingly short bottom bars. The story is clear: some categories thrive, some struggle, and healthcare/luxury are nearly invisible.

OVERALL MOOD:
Professional, data-driven, clean, slightly alarming. Like discovering uncomfortable data in a board presentation.

NOT: Infographic style, colorful, busy, decorative. No icons, no illustrations, no embellishments.

COLOR PALETTE SUMMARY:
- Background top: #1e2432
- Background bottom: #171c26
- Winning bars (top 4): #c9a86c
- Middle bars (4): #8a8f98
- Losing bars (bottom 2): #4a4f58
- Text primary: #e8eaed
- Text secondary: #8a8f98
- Gold glow: #c9a86c at 8-10%

DIMENSIONS: 1920x1080px

TEXT LABELS:
- "Consulting" - "80%"
- "SaaS" - "70%"
- "Education" - "70%"
- "Fintech" - "60%"
- "DTC" - "50%"
- "Travel" - "50%"
- "Agencies" - "40%"
- "Local Services" - "40%"
- "Healthcare" - "10%"
- "Luxury" - "10%"

AVOID:
- Grid lines or axis markings
- 3D effects or perspective
- Multiple colors for different bars (stick to gold/gray/dark progression)
- Decorative elements or icons
- Busy backgrounds or textures
- Infographic style with icons for each category
- Vertical bar chart orientation
- Animation indicators (this is a static image)
- Brand logos
- Shadows under bars (keep flat)

## BROLL-02: Category Leadership Ladder

**Timestamp:** 5:00
**Supports:** "Think of it like a ladder. AI only sees the top three rungs."
**Purpose:** Visualize that only category leaders get AI visibility

### Prompt:

Elegant minimal illustration of a vertical ladder where only the top three rungs are illuminated and visible, while lower rungs fade into darkness. The image represents the concept that AI systems only "see" and recommend category leaders, ignoring everyone else.

BACKGROUND:
Solid deep navy-charcoal (#1e2432) with a subtle vertical gradient getting slightly darker (#171c26) toward the bottom of the frame. NO grid lines, NO texture, NO patterns. The darkness at the bottom reinforces the "invisibility" of lower positions.

COMPOSITION:
The ladder is positioned slightly left of center (approximately 40% from left edge) and extends vertically through the frame. The ladder should span from approximately 15% from the bottom to 85% from the top of the frame. The rightward offset leaves room for potential annotation or creates visual balance.

LADDER STRUCTURE:
A clean, minimal ladder silhouette with:
- Two vertical side rails: Thin, elegant lines (approximately 4-6px width)
- Seven horizontal rungs: Evenly spaced, same line weight as rails

The ladder should feel architectural and premium - not cartoony or illustrative. Think of it as a simplified icon rendered at high resolution.

VISIBILITY TREATMENT:
This is the key visual element. The top 3 rungs and their adjacent rail sections are clearly visible. Everything below fades dramatically.

- Rung 1 (top): Warm gold (#c9a86c) - brightest, most prominent
- Rung 2: Warm gold (#c9a86c) at 85% brightness
- Rung 3: Warm gold (#c9a86c) at 70% brightness
- Rung 4: Soft silver-gray (#6a6f78) at 50% opacity - transitioning
- Rung 5: Darker gray (#4a4f58) at 35% opacity
- Rung 6: Very dark (#3a3f48) at 20% opacity
- Rung 7 (bottom): Nearly invisible (#2a2f38) at 10% opacity

The side rails follow the same fade pattern - bright gold at top, fading to near-invisible at bottom.

GLOW EFFECT:
The top three rungs have a subtle glow effect:
- Warm gold glow (#c9a86c) at 12-15% opacity
- Large feather radius (40-60px)
- Creates an aura of "visibility" around the top positions

The glow should be strongest around the top rung and progressively less intense on rungs 2 and 3.

POSITION LABELS:
Small, clean labels to the right of each visible rung:
- "#1" next to top rung
- "#2" next to second rung
- "#3" next to third rung

Font: Clean sans-serif, 18-22px, soft silver-white (#e8eaed)
Position: Right of the rung with comfortable spacing (20-30px gap)

Below rung 3, no labels - reinforcing that positions below don't matter.

VISUAL METAPHOR ENHANCEMENT:
A subtle gradient "spotlight" effect from above, as if a light source is illuminating only the top portion of the ladder. This should be very subtle - not a visible beam, just a slightly brighter area in the upper portion of the frame that naturally fades.

OPTIONAL ANNOTATION:
If needed for clarity, small text in the upper right:
- "AI VISIBILITY"
- Font: Same sans-serif, 14px
- Color: Medium gray (#8a8f98)
- Style: All caps, letter-spacing 2px

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
The viewer immediately understands: the top three positions are visible, everything else disappears into darkness. The gold illumination draws the eye upward, reinforcing the aspiration to reach the top rungs.

OVERALL MOOD:
Aspirational, slightly ominous, clarity of hierarchy. Premium and sophisticated - not playful.

NOT: Cartoon ladder, wooden texture, 3D perspective, photorealistic, multiple colors.

COLOR PALETTE SUMMARY:
- Background: #1e2432 to #171c26 (vertical gradient)
- Top 3 rungs: #c9a86c (gold, with opacity variation)
- Fading rungs: #6a6f78, #4a4f58, #3a3f48, #2a2f38
- Labels: #e8eaed
- Glow: #c9a86c at 12-15%

DIMENSIONS: 1920x1080px

TEXT LABELS:
- "#1" (next to top rung)
- "#2" (next to second rung)
- "#3" (next to third rung)

AVOID:
- Cartoon or illustrated ladder style
- Wood grain or realistic textures
- 3D perspective view
- Multiple people climbing the ladder
- Decorative elements (stars, checkmarks)
- Bright colors beyond gold
- Horizontal ladder orientation
- Background patterns or grids
- Complex shading or gradients on the ladder itself

## BROLL-03: Visibility Trifecta Diagram

**Timestamp:** 4:50
**Supports:** "The brands that show up have three things in common. I call this the Visibility Trifecta."
**Purpose:** Introduce the three-element framework for AI visibility

### Prompt:

Elegant minimal Venn diagram showing three overlapping circles representing the "Visibility Trifecta" - the three elements brands need for AI visibility: Category Leadership, Clear Positioning, and Third-Party Validation. The intersection of all three represents optimal AI visibility.

BACKGROUND:
Solid deep navy-charcoal gradient (#1e2432 at top transitioning subtly to #171c26 at bottom). NO grid lines, NO texture, NO patterns. Clean, premium backdrop that lets the diagram be the sole focus.

COMPOSITION:
The three circles are arranged in a classic Venn diagram configuration - two circles at the top, one at the bottom, all overlapping in the center. The entire diagram is centered both horizontally and vertically in the frame. The diagram should occupy approximately 60-65% of the frame width.

CIRCLE SPECIFICATIONS:
Three circles of equal size, each approximately 380-420px in diameter at 1920x1080 resolution.

Circle positions (center points):
- Circle 1 (Category Leadership): Upper left, approximately 35% from left, 40% from top
- Circle 2 (Clear Positioning): Upper right, approximately 65% from left, 40% from top
- Circle 3 (Third-Party Validation): Bottom center, approximately 50% from left, 65% from top

The overlap should be significant - approximately 30-35% of each circle overlaps with its neighbors.

CIRCLE STYLING:
Each circle rendered as:
- Outline only (no fill): 2-3px stroke weight
- Color: Soft silver-gray (#8a8f98) at 60% opacity
- Subtle inner glow: Same silver at 5% opacity

This creates elegant, ethereal circles that don't compete with the text.

OVERLAP ZONES:
The overlapping areas have subtle treatment:
- Two-circle overlaps: Slightly lighter (#9a9fa8) at 15% opacity fill
- Three-circle overlap (center): Warm gold (#c9a86c) at 25% opacity fill with subtle gold glow

The center intersection is the "sweet spot" - where all three elements combine for maximum visibility.

LABELS FOR EACH CIRCLE:
Text positioned in the non-overlapping portion of each circle:

Circle 1 (top left):
- "CATEGORY" (line 1)
- "LEADERSHIP" (line 2)
- Font: Clean sans-serif, bold (600), 22-26px
- Color: Soft silver-white (#e8eaed)
- Centered in the unique area of the circle

Circle 2 (top right):
- "CLEAR" (line 1)
- "POSITIONING" (line 2)
- Same styling as Circle 1

Circle 3 (bottom):
- "THIRD-PARTY" (line 1)
- "VALIDATION" (line 2)
- Same styling

CENTER LABEL:
In the three-way intersection (the golden center):
- "VISIBLE" or small icon suggesting visibility
- Font: Clean sans-serif, bold, 18-20px
- Color: Warm gold (#c9a86c)
- Or: A simple "eye" icon in gold, very minimal

VISUAL HIERARCHY:
The gold center should be the focal point - it represents where brands achieve AI visibility. The three labels around it explain what's needed to reach that center.

OPTIONAL TITLE:
Small title above the diagram:
- "THE VISIBILITY TRIFECTA"
- Font: Same sans-serif, 14px, letter-spacing 3px
- Color: Medium gray (#8a8f98)
- All caps

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
The viewer sees three distinct requirements (the circles), understands they overlap (relationships matter), and focuses on the golden center (the goal). Each element is necessary but not sufficient alone.

OVERALL MOOD:
Strategic, clear, framework-oriented. Like a consulting presentation explaining a methodology.

NOT: Colorful Venn diagram, filled circles, playful or illustrative style, 3D effects.

COLOR PALETTE SUMMARY:
- Background: #1e2432 to #171c26
- Circle outlines: #8a8f98 at 60%
- Two-way overlaps: #9a9fa8 at 15%
- Three-way overlap (center): #c9a86c at 25%
- Labels: #e8eaed
- Center text/icon: #c9a86c
- Title: #8a8f98

DIMENSIONS: 1920x1080px

TEXT LABELS:
- "CATEGORY LEADERSHIP" (Circle 1)
- "CLEAR POSITIONING" (Circle 2)
- "THIRD-PARTY VALIDATION" (Circle 3)
- "VISIBLE" (center, optional)
- "THE VISIBILITY TRIFECTA" (title, optional)

AVOID:
- Filled/solid circles
- Bright or multiple colors for different circles
- 3D perspective or shading
- Icons inside each circle representing the concept
- Complex overlapping patterns
- Drop shadows
- Decorative elements
- Photorealistic styling
- Asymmetrical circle sizes

## BROLL-04: B2B Blindspot Visual

**Timestamp:** 7:00
**Supports:** "If your business model is B2B, you have a visibility gap that B2C companies don't face"
**Purpose:** Show the dramatic difference between consumer and B2B query volume

### Prompt:

Elegant minimal comparison visualization showing the dramatic imbalance between consumer queries (which dominate AI search) and B2B queries (which are rare). The visual should immediately communicate that B2B brands face a structural disadvantage in AI visibility.

BACKGROUND:
Solid deep navy-charcoal gradient (#1e2432 at top transitioning subtly to #171c26 at bottom). NO grid lines, NO texture, NO patterns. Clean backdrop for a clear data story.

COMPOSITION:
Split composition with strong visual asymmetry. The frame is divided conceptually (not with a hard line) into two sections:
- Left side (approximately 75% of frame): Consumer queries - LARGE, dominant
- Right side (approximately 25% of frame): B2B queries - small, marginalized

This asymmetry IS the message. Don't use a 50/50 split.

VISUAL TREATMENT:

Consumer Side (Left - 75%):
A large, prominent circle or rounded rectangle representing consumer query volume.
- Size: Approximately 500-550px diameter/height
- Color: Warm gold (#c9a86c) - visible, dominant, winning
- Position: Centered in the left portion of the frame
- Subtle glow: Gold at 10% opacity, large feather

Label below or inside:
- "CONSUMER"
- Font: Clean sans-serif, bold, 24-28px
- Color: Dark navy (#1e2432) if inside gold shape, or silver (#e8eaed) if below

Secondary label:
- "99% of AI queries"
- Font: Same sans-serif, regular, 16-18px
- Color: Medium gray (#8a8f98) if inside, silver (#e8eaed) if below

B2B Side (Right - 25%):
A much smaller circle or rounded rectangle representing B2B query volume.
- Size: Approximately 80-100px diameter/height (dramatically smaller)
- Color: Muted gray (#4a4f58) - invisible, marginalized
- Position: Right portion of frame, vertically centered
- No glow - reinforcing its "invisibility"

Label:
- "B2B"
- Font: Same sans-serif, bold, 18-20px
- Color: Soft silver (#e8eaed)

Secondary label:
- "1% of queries"
- Font: Same sans-serif, regular, 14-16px
- Color: Darker gray (#6a6f78)

ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT (Bar Style):
If circles don't read well, use horizontal bars:
- Consumer bar: Full width (nearly edge to edge), gold, prominent
- B2B bar: Very short bar below it, gray, small
Same labeling approach.

BRAND EXAMPLES (Optional):
Small brand name labels near each element:
- Near consumer: "Robinhood, Chime, Revolut" in small gray text
- Near B2B: "Stripe, Square" in small gray text

This grounds the abstract concept in real examples from the video.

VISUAL METAPHOR:
The size difference should be shocking. The consumer element should DOMINATE the frame while the B2B element is almost lost in the corner. This visual imbalance tells the story instantly.

DIVIDING ELEMENT:
A subtle vertical line or gradient transition between the two zones:
- Not a hard line, but a soft gradient or very subtle (1px) divider
- Color: #3a3f48 or transparent gradient
- Position: Approximately 70% from left

TITLE (Optional):
- "THE B2B BLINDSPOT"
- Font: Clean sans-serif, 14px, letter-spacing 3px, all caps
- Color: Medium gray (#8a8f98)
- Position: Top of frame, centered

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
Instant recognition that consumer queries overwhelm B2B queries. The Stripe revelation from the hook lands visually - a $100B company is invisible because they're in the tiny B2B bucket, not the massive consumer bucket.

OVERALL MOOD:
Eye-opening, slightly alarming, data-driven. The imbalance should feel uncomfortable.

NOT: 50/50 split, pie chart, equal representation, colorful, playful.

COLOR PALETTE SUMMARY:
- Background: #1e2432 to #171c26
- Consumer element: #c9a86c (gold)
- B2B element: #4a4f58 (muted gray)
- Primary labels: #e8eaed
- Secondary labels: #8a8f98 or #6a6f78
- Gold glow: #c9a86c at 10%
- Divider: #3a3f48

DIMENSIONS: 1920x1080px

TEXT LABELS:
- "CONSUMER" with "99% of AI queries"
- "B2B" with "1% of queries"
- Optional: Brand examples, title

AVOID:
- Equal-sized elements (defeats the purpose)
- Pie chart representation
- Multiple colors
- Decorative icons (shopping cart, briefcase, etc.)
- 3D effects
- Photorealistic elements
- Complex data visualization
- Infographic style with icons

## BROLL-05: Me Too vs Category Definer Comparison

**Timestamp:** 7:30
**Supports:** "If you're 'another option' instead of 'THE option' - AI doesn't bother mentioning you"
**Purpose:** Contrast brands that defined categories vs brands that followed

### Prompt:

Elegant minimal side-by-side comparison showing the difference between "Category Definers" (brands that created or defined their category) who are visible to AI, and "Me Too" brands (followers in crowded categories) who are invisible. The visual should make the distinction immediately clear.

BACKGROUND:
Solid deep navy-charcoal (#1e2432) uniform across the frame. NO grid lines, NO texture, NO patterns. Clean backdrop for a clear A/B comparison.

COMPOSITION:
True split-screen composition divided vertically down the center:
- Left side (50%): Category Definers - VISIBLE treatment
- Right side (50%): Me Too brands - INVISIBLE treatment

A subtle vertical divider in the center separates the two worlds.

LEFT SIDE - CATEGORY DEFINERS:

Header:
- "CATEGORY DEFINERS"
- Font: Clean sans-serif, bold, 22-26px
- Color: Warm gold (#c9a86c)
- Position: Upper portion of left half, centered

Visual treatment: Three brand names stacked vertically, clearly visible
- "Warby Parker"
- "Glossier"
- "Away"

Typography for brand names:
- Font: Clean sans-serif, medium weight, 20-24px
- Color: Soft silver-white (#e8eaed)
- Spacing: Comfortable vertical spacing between names (30-40px)
- Position: Centered in the left half, below the header

Each brand name has a subtle gold glow or gold accent (small gold dot or line to the left) indicating visibility.

Subtext below brand names:
- "Defined their category"
- Font: Same sans-serif, italic or light, 14-16px
- Color: Medium gray (#8a8f98)

RIGHT SIDE - ME TOO BRANDS:

Header:
- "ME TOO"
- Font: Clean sans-serif, bold, 22-26px
- Color: Muted gray (#6a6f78)
- Position: Upper portion of right half, centered

Visual treatment: Three brand names stacked vertically, faded/ghosted
- "Casper"
- "Bombas"
- "MVMT"

Typography for brand names:
- Font: Same clean sans-serif, medium weight, 20-24px
- Color: Dark muted gray (#4a4f58) at 50-60% opacity - ghosted appearance
- Same spacing as left side

No glow or accent - these brands fade into the background.

Subtext below brand names:
- "One of many options"
- Font: Same sans-serif, italic or light, 14-16px
- Color: Darker gray (#4a4f58)

CENTER DIVIDER:
A subtle vertical line separating the two halves:
- Width: 1-2px
- Color: #3a3f48 (subtle, not prominent)
- Height: Approximately 60% of frame height, centered vertically
- Or: A subtle gradient transition instead of hard line

VS INDICATOR:
At the intersection point (center of frame, vertically centered):
- "VS" in a subtle circle or just as text
- Font: Bold, 16-18px
- Color: Medium gray (#6a6f78)
- Or: Omit if the divider is sufficient

VISUAL HIERARCHY:
The left side should feel bright, prominent, visible. The right side should feel faded, ghosted, invisible. The contrast should be stark but elegant.

OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT:
Small "visibility indicators" next to each brand:
- Left side: Small gold "eye" icon or checkmark
- Right side: Small gray "crossed out eye" icon or X

Keep these minimal if included - small enough to not dominate.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
The viewer immediately sees two groups of brands. The left group is clear and prominent (visible to AI). The right group is faded and ghostly (invisible to AI). The message is clear: define your category or disappear.

OVERALL MOOD:
Stark contrast, clear distinction, slightly cautionary. Premium presentation style.

NOT: Colorful, playful, using brand logos, infographic icons, checkmarks/X marks that are too prominent.

COLOR PALETTE SUMMARY:
- Background: #1e2432
- Category Definer header: #c9a86c (gold)
- Category Definer brands: #e8eaed
- Me Too header: #6a6f78
- Me Too brands: #4a4f58 at 50-60%
- Subtext: #8a8f98 (left), #4a4f58 (right)
- Divider: #3a3f48
- VS text: #6a6f78

DIMENSIONS: 1920x1080px

TEXT LABELS:
- "CATEGORY DEFINERS" (left header)
- "Warby Parker", "Glossier", "Away" (left brands)
- "Defined their category" (left subtext)
- "ME TOO" (right header)
- "Casper", "Bombas", "MVMT" (right brands)
- "One of many options" (right subtext)
- "VS" (center, optional)

AVOID:
- Brand logos (use text only)
- Colorful treatments for different brands
- Complex icons or illustrations
- Asymmetrical composition (keep it balanced)
- Heavy divider line
- 3D effects or perspective
- Decorative elements
- Product images

## BROLL-06: 53% Invisible Stat Card

**Timestamp:** 2:30
**Supports:** "53% of well-known brands never got mentioned. Not once."
**Purpose:** Create a bold, memorable statistic visualization

### Prompt:

Bold, impactful stat card displaying "53% INVISIBLE" as the dominant visual element. This should be a clean, striking graphic that delivers the key finding of the audit in a single frame. Think premium keynote slide with one powerful statistic.

BACKGROUND:
Solid deep navy-charcoal (#1e2432) uniform across the frame. NO grid lines, NO texture, NO patterns. The background should be completely clean to let the statistic dominate.

COMPOSITION:
Centered composition with the statistic as the overwhelming focal point. The number takes up significant vertical space (approximately 35-40% of frame height). Everything is centered both horizontally and vertically, with the main stat slightly above true center for visual balance.

PRIMARY STATISTIC:
"53%"
- Font: Clean sans-serif, extra bold (800 or 900 weight)
- Size: LARGE - approximately 280-350px tall
- Color: Warm gold (#c9a86c)
- Position: Centered horizontally, positioned at approximately 40% from top
- Subtle glow: Gold at 10-12% opacity, large feather radius (60-80px)

The number should feel monumental - this is the key takeaway of the entire video.

SUPPORTING TEXT:
"INVISIBLE" directly below the percentage
- Font: Same sans-serif, bold (600), all caps
- Size: 60-80px
- Color: Soft silver-white (#e8eaed)
- Letter-spacing: 8-12px (wide tracking for impact)
- Position: Centered, with comfortable spacing below the percentage (30-40px gap)

CONTEXT LINE:
Smaller explanatory text below "INVISIBLE"
- "of brands never got mentioned"
- Font: Same sans-serif, regular weight, 20-24px
- Color: Medium gray (#8a8f98)
- Position: Centered, with spacing below "INVISIBLE" (20-30px gap)

VISUAL EMPHASIS:
The gold percentage with its subtle glow creates a "spotlight" effect - this number is what viewers should remember. The supporting text provides context without competing for attention.

OPTIONAL ACCENT:
A very subtle horizontal line below the context text:
- Width: 100-150px
- Height: 2px
- Color: #3a3f48
- Centered horizontally
- Adds a subtle "end punctuation" to the visual

OPTIONAL BRAND CONTEXT:
Small text at the bottom of the frame:
- "100 brands audited across ChatGPT & Gemini"
- Font: Same sans-serif, 14px
- Color: Dark gray (#4a4f58)
- Position: Bottom center, with generous margin from edge

ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT:
If more visual interest is needed, the "53" could have a subtle gradient within the gold:
- Top of numbers: Brighter gold (#d4b574)
- Bottom of numbers: Standard gold (#c9a86c)
- Very subtle transition, not pronounced

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
One number. One message. The viewer sees "53% INVISIBLE" and immediately understands the scale of the problem. No distraction, no competition - just the brutal statistic.

OVERALL MOOD:
Alarming, bold, memorable. The kind of stat that makes you pause. Premium presentation quality.

NOT: Infographic style with multiple stats, pie charts, complex data, decorative elements, playful treatment.

COLOR PALETTE SUMMARY:
- Background: #1e2432
- Primary stat (53%): #c9a86c
- Gold glow: #c9a86c at 10-12%
- "INVISIBLE": #e8eaed
- Context text: #8a8f98

## BROLL-07: Noise-Canceling Headphones Metaphor

**Timestamp:** 10:30
**Supports:** "They'll be shouting into a room where everyone is wearing noise-canceling headphones"
**Purpose:** Create a memorable visual metaphor for the consequence of invisibility

### Prompt:

Elegant minimal illustration depicting the metaphor of "shouting into a room where everyone has noise-canceling headphones" - visualizing the futility of brands trying to reach customers who can't hear them because AI filters their messages out.

BACKGROUND:
Solid deep navy-charcoal gradient (#1e2432 at top transitioning subtly to #171c26 at bottom). NO grid lines, NO texture, NO patterns. Clean, premium backdrop.

COMPOSITION:
The scene is arranged as a subtle visual metaphor, not a literal illustration. Two key elements:
1. A figure/silhouette on the left - representing the brand "shouting"
2. Multiple figures/silhouettes on the right - representing audiences wearing headphones

The composition flows left to right, showing the communication breakdown.

LEFT SIDE - THE SHOUTING BRAND:

A simplified human silhouette (business professional shape) positioned in the left third of the frame.
- Style: Clean, minimal silhouette - not detailed, not cartoony
- Color: Muted gray (#6a6f78) - the brand is visible but ineffective
- Size: Approximately 250-300px tall
- Position: Left third of frame, vertically centered

Visual indicators of "shouting":
- Simple sound wave lines emanating from the figure toward the right
- 3-4 curved lines, progressively smaller/fainter
- Color: Muted gray (#5a5f68) fading to (#3a3f48)
- The waves should FADE before reaching the audience - they're not getting through

Optional: A small megaphone shape in the figure's hand, same gray color.

RIGHT SIDE - THE UNHEARING AUDIENCE:

Three simplified human silhouettes arranged in a slight arc or row, each wearing headphones.
- Style: Same clean, minimal silhouettes
- Color: Soft silver-white (#e8eaed) - they're in their own world, unbothered
- Size: Similar or slightly smaller than left figure
- Position: Right two-thirds of frame, with comfortable spacing between figures

Headphones treatment:
- Simple, clean headphone shape on each figure
- Color: Warm gold (#c9a86c)
- The gold headphones are the focal point - they represent the AI filter that blocks unwanted brands

Optional: Subtle gold glow around the headphones (same gold at 8-10% opacity) emphasizing their "active" noise-canceling.

THE DISCONNECT:

The visual gap between the fading sound waves and the shielded audience is crucial. The message doesn't reach them. Options:
- Sound waves literally fade to nothing before reaching audience
- A subtle barrier or gradient in the center where waves disappear
- Small "X" marks or broken wave symbols showing blocked communication

VISUAL BALANCE:

Left figure (brand): Darker, straining, ineffective
Right figures (audience): Lighter, relaxed, protected by gold headphones
The contrast tells the story - effort vs. indifference.

OPTIONAL TEXT:

Small text at the bottom or integrated subtly:
- Left side: "Your brand" (small, gray)
- Right side: "Your customers" (small, gray)

Or: No text, let the image speak.

SILHOUETTE STYLE GUIDANCE:

The figures should be:
- Simplified human shapes (not stick figures, not detailed illustrations)
- Gender-neutral, professional appearance
- Standing pose, not action poses
- Minimal detail - no facial features, just shape recognition

Think: Bathroom sign people but slightly more sophisticated.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:

The brand is working hard to be heard (shouting, sound waves), but the audience is completely insulated by their "AI headphones." The message never lands. It's a powerful visual metaphor for the consequence of AI invisibility.

OVERALL MOOD:

Slightly melancholy, cautionary, memorable. The viewer should feel the futility of the left figure's efforts.

NOT: Cartoon style, detailed illustration, photorealistic people, noisy/busy composition, multiple colors.

COLOR PALETTE SUMMARY:
- Background: #1e2432 to #171c26
- Brand silhouette: #6a6f78
- Sound waves: #5a5f68 fading to #3a3f48
- Audience silhouettes: #e8eaed
- Headphones: #c9a86c (gold)
- Headphone glow: #c9a86c at 8-10%
- Optional labels: #8a8f98

DIMENSIONS: 1920x1080px

AVOID:
- Detailed facial features or expressions

- Complex room/environment details
- Actual words being "shouted"
- Emoji or icons instead of silhouettes
