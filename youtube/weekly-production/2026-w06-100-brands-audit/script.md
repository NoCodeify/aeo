### Round 2: 6 -> 3

**Matchup 1: Hook 1 vs Hook 2**
- Hook 1: Strong stat, but "don't exist" is confusing (they exist, just invisible)
- Hook 2: Origin story is GOLD. Personal. "Should terrify you" is strong.
- **Winner: Hook 2** (Origin story + personal stakes)

**Matchup 2: Hook 3 vs Hook 4**
- Hook 3: Good but "half of brands you know" is vague
- Hook 4: Specific data (90% healthcare vs 80% consulting) creates curiosity
- **Winner: Hook 4** (Specificity + category tension)

**Matchup 3: Hook 5 vs Hook 6**
- Hook 5: Relatable but generic frustration
- Hook 6: Stripe reveal is SHOCKING. $100B company invisible = pattern interrupt
- **Winner: Hook 6** (Unexpected, high-profile example)

---

### Round 3: 3 -> 1

**Semi-Final: Hook 2 vs Hook 4 vs Hook 6**

| Criteria | Hook 2 (Origin) | Hook 4 (Data) | Hook 6 (Stripe) |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Pattern Interrupt (40%) | 8/10 | 7/10 | 9/10 |
| Credibility Fit (25%) | 10/10 | 7/10 | 8/10 |
| Curiosity Gap (30%) | 8/10 | 8/10 | 9/10 |
| Natural Flow (5%) | 9/10 | 7/10 | 8/10 |
| **TOTAL** | 8.5 | 7.3 | 8.6 |

**Winner: Hook 6 (Stripe)** - But we'll weave in origin story during setup.

**Reasoning:** The Stripe reveal is the strongest pattern interrupt. A $100B company being invisible to AI is counterintuitive and creates immediate "wait, what?" The origin story (BMW/Porsche) works better in the setup where we have time to develop it.

## FINAL SCRIPT

### === HOOK (45 seconds) ===

Stripe is one of the biggest fintech companies in the world. 100 billion dollar valuation. Powers payments for Amazon, Google, Shopify.

ChatGPT doesn't mention them. At all.

I audited 100 brands across 10 categories. And the pattern I found explains why half of them are completely invisible.

I've spent three years building businesses on AI. I scaled a clinic from zero to 10 million euros using AI systems. I know what makes these algorithms recommend you.

And what I'm about to show you should make you uncomfortable. Because your brand might be next.

By the end of this video, you'll know exactly what separates the brands ChatGPT recommends from the ones it ignores. And the third pattern I found? Nobody is talking about it.

---

### === SETUP (2 minutes) ===

Let me tell you why I did this audit.

Last year, I was about to buy my third BMW. I'd already decided.

But I asked ChatGPT for advice first. Just curious.

It didn't recommend BMW. It recommended a Porsche Boxster. Gave me five reasons why it was a better fit for what I wanted.

I bought the Porsche.

[PAUSE]

That's when it hit me. If AI can change MY buying decision - a decision I'd already made - what is it doing to millions of other people every day?

So I decided to find out. I took 100 brands across 10 industries and asked ChatGPT and Gemini one simple question: "What's the best [category]?"

CRM software. Consulting firms. Hotels. Fintech apps. Travel sites. You name it.

The results were brutal.

53% of well-known brands never got mentioned. Not once.

But here's what's interesting. It wasn't random. There's a clear pattern separating the winners from the losers.

And once you see it, you can't unsee it.

### === MAIN CONTENT (7 minutes) ===

---

#### SECTION 1: The Category Breakdown (2 minutes)

Let me show you the data.

[SCREEN: Category visibility chart]

I tested 10 categories. 10 brands each. Here's how they ranked:

Consulting firms? 80% visible. McKinsey, BCG, Bain, Deloitte - ChatGPT knows them all.

SaaS and tech? 70% visible. HubSpot, Notion, Monday.com - the category leaders show up.

Education platforms? 70%. Coursera, Skillshare, Teachable.

Now look at the bottom.

Healthcare and clinics? 10% visible.

One out of ten brands got mentioned.

Local services? 40%.

Agencies? 40%.

[GIF: Shocked reaction]

The gap between the best and worst categories is 8x.

Same effort. Same brand awareness. Completely different outcomes in AI search.

So what's going on?

---

#### SECTION 2: What Gets You Mentioned (2 minutes)

The brands that show up have three things in common. I call this the Visibility Trifecta.

**First: Category Leadership.**

Think of it like a ladder. AI only sees the top three rungs.

When I asked "What's the best CRM software?" - HubSpot showed up. Salesforce showed up. Zoho showed up.

Pipedrive? Sometimes. Freshsales? Rarely. The 15 other CRM tools? Never.

If you're not in the top 3 of your category, AI doesn't know you exist.

**Second: Clear Positioning.**

Every brand that showed up had a "best for" statement.

HubSpot is "best for SMBs who want all-in-one."
Notion is "best for docs and light project management."
Wealthfront is "best robo-advisor for passive investors."

They didn't try to be everything. They owned a specific use case.

The brands with vague positioning? Invisible.

**Third: Third-Party Validation.**

This one surprised me.

The brands that show up consistently have reviews on G2, Clutch, Gartner. They've won awards. They get mentioned in "best of" articles.

AI isn't making these recommendations from scratch. It's pulling from what OTHER sources say about you.

No third-party mentions? No AI mentions.

---

#### SECTION 3: What Makes You Invisible (2.5 minutes)

Now let's talk about what kills visibility. This is where it gets uncomfortable.

**The B2B Blindspot.**

Remember Stripe? $100 billion company. Powers half the internet.

Here's what's interesting. Stripe dominates developer conversations. Every startup uses them. But when I asked ChatGPT "What's the best payment processor for my online store?" - Stripe barely showed up.

Why? Because B2B companies have historically ignored content marketing. They rely on word of mouth, sales teams, integrations.

But now decisions start with AI. Your potential customers are asking ChatGPT "Stripe vs Adyen" or "best payment API for SaaS" before they ever talk to sales.

And if you're not showing up in those queries? You're not even in the consideration set.

The blindspot isn't that B2B companies need consumer visibility. It's that they need ANY visibility in the queries their buyers actually make.

**The "Me Too" Problem.**

Look at DTC brands. Warby Parker? Visible. Glossier? Visible. Away luggage? Visible.

Casper? Invisible. Bombas? Invisible. MVMT Watches? Invisible.

The difference isn't brand size. It's category definition.

Warby Parker defined "DTC eyewear." Glossier defined "community-led beauty."

Casper was one of many mattress companies. Bombas was one of many sock brands.

If you're "another option" instead of "THE option" - AI doesn't bother mentioning you.

**The Healthcare Disaster.**

This one was brutal.

10 healthcare brands. 1 got mentioned.

Cleveland Clinic? One of the best hospitals in the world. Invisible.

Mayo Clinic? Invisible.

Why? Because when people ask AI about healthcare, they're asking about telehealth platforms. Teladoc. MDLive. Hims and Hers.

Traditional healthcare brands haven't adapted their positioning for AI search. They're still optimizing for "healthcare near me."

That query doesn't exist in ChatGPT.

---

#### SECTION 4: The Pattern Nobody Talks About (0.5 minutes)

Here's the third pattern I promised you.

ChatGPT and Gemini disagree. A lot.

I ran the same queries on both. Different brands showed up.

SoFi appeared on ChatGPT but not Gemini.
Robinhood appeared on Gemini but not ChatGPT.
Tony Robbins? Gemini only.

Each AI has different training data. Different sources. Different recency.

If you're only optimizing for one AI, you're missing half the market.

---

### === PAYOFF (1.5 minutes) ===

So let's bring this together.

I audited 100 brands. 53% were invisible.

The winners had three things: category leadership, clear positioning, and third-party validation.

The losers made three mistakes: B2B blindspot, "me too" positioning, and ignoring how AI actually searches.

And here's what this means for you.

If you're in healthcare, local services, or running an agency - you have a visibility problem. Your category is 40-90% invisible.

If you're B2B, you need to think about how consumers search for your category - not just how businesses find you.

And if you don't have a clear "best for" statement? Start there. Because that's what AI is looking for.

The brands that figure this out first will dominate the next decade of search.

The ones that don't?

They'll be shouting into a room where everyone is wearing noise-canceling headphones.

### === CTA (30 seconds) ===

Now you know the problem. But knowing isn't enough.

I put together a free checklist that walks you through exactly how to fix this. The same framework I use with clients.

Link's in the description.

I'll see you in the next one.
