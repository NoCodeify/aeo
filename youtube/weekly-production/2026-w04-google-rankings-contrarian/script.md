## HOOK TOURNAMENT

### Round 1: 6 Hooks

**Hook A (Personal Story Opening):**
> I was on my second BMW. I was about to buy my third. But I made the mistake of asking ChatGPT for advice. It convinced me to buy a Porsche instead. And that's when everything I believed about marketing changed.

**Hook B (Surprising Data):**
> My client ranked number 3 on Google for their most important keyword. Their SEO agency was celebrating. But when I checked ChatGPT and Gemini, they weren't mentioned at all. That's when I realized - Google rankings don't tell you what matters anymore.

**Hook C (Contrarian Statement):**
> I used to check Google rankings obsessively. Every morning, first thing. Now I don't check them at all. And my clients' businesses have never grown faster. Here's what changed.

**Hook D (Specific Result):**
> I helped a client go from completely invisible in AI search to getting mentioned 70% of the time in Gemini. Their Google ranking? It stayed exactly the same. Third place. The difference? AI visibility drives decisions. Rankings just drive ego.

**Hook E (Provocative Question):**
> What if everything you think you know about SEO is wrong? What if the rankings you've been obsessing over don't actually matter for your business? What if there's something else you should be tracking instead?

**Hook F (Pattern Interrupt):**
> Stop checking your Google rankings. Seriously. Close that tab right now. Because I'm about to show you what actually matters in 2026, and it's not where you rank on Google.

### Round 2: Top 3

**Advancing: A, B, D**

- Hook A advances: Strong personal story, unexpected twist (AI convinced a purchase), leads naturally to "what changed"
- Hook B advances: Real data, relatable scenario (SEO agency celebrating), concrete problem revealed
- Hook D advances: Specific numbers (70%, third place), clear contrast, memorable phrase ("AI visibility drives decisions")

**Eliminated:**
- Hook C: Too generic, doesn't have the story punch
- Hook E: Too many questions, no story
- Hook F: Aggressive opener might turn viewers off

### Round 3: Winner

**WINNER: Hook A (Personal Story Opening)**

**Why Hook A Won:**
1. **Most memorable** - BMW to Porsche story is concrete and relatable
2. **Stakes are clear** - $35K decision changed by AI
3. **Personal credibility** - "I experienced this myself"
4. **Natural lead-in** - "everything I believed changed" creates massive curiosity gap
5. **Ed Lawrence pattern** - Personal contrarian action with result (2.7x multiplier)

**Why B and D lost:**
- Hook B starts with client, not personal - less immediate connection
- Hook D leads with numbers, less emotionally engaging opener

## HOOK (0:00 - 0:45)

**[WHY THIS HOOK WON]:** Personal story with unexpected outcome + clear stakes ($35K) + massive curiosity gap ("everything changed")

### Line 1: Pattern Interrupt
> I was on my second BMW. I loved those cars. I was absolutely certain I was going to buy my third one.

**[B-ROLL: BMW 3-series, sleek shot, desirable]**

### Line 2: Credibility
> I'd already scaled a hair clinic from zero to five million dollars. Then from five million to ten million. I thought I understood how people made decisions.

### Line 3: Empathy
> But before buying, I made the mistake of asking ChatGPT for advice on what car I should get.

**[B-ROLL: ChatGPT interface, typing in query]**

### Line 4: Promise
> It analyzed my preferences, my budget, my driving style. And it came back with a recommendation I didn't expect - a Porsche Boxster.

**[B-ROLL: Porsche 987 Boxster, dramatic reveal]**

### Line 5: Teaser
> I bought the Porsche. And that's when I realized - everything I thought I knew about marketing was wrong. If an AI could change MY buying decision on a car I was certain about, what was it doing to my clients' businesses?

---

## SETUP (0:45 - 2:30)

### Establish the Problem
> Here's what most business owners are doing right now. They're checking their Google rankings. Every day. Sometimes multiple times a day. They're paying SEO agencies thousands of dollars a month to move from position 5 to position 3. They're celebrating when they hit page one.

**[B-ROLL: Google SERP, rankings dashboard, position tracking]**

> And I get it. I used to do the same thing. For years, Google rankings were THE metric. If you ranked well, you won. If you didn't, you lost.

### Create Tension
> But something has fundamentally changed. And most businesses haven't noticed yet. The question is no longer "where do you rank on Google?" The question is "does ChatGPT recommend you?"

**[B-ROLL: ChatGPT and Gemini logos, AI search interfaces]**

> Because millions of people are now making buying decisions by asking AI assistants. And those AI assistants don't care about your Google ranking.

**[GIF: "mind blown" reaction]**

## POINT 1: The Wake-Up Call (2:30 - 4:30)

**Story/Example:**
> Let me tell you exactly what happened with that Porsche. I'd been a BMW guy for years. Two cars. Loved the brand. Was completely loyal.

**[B-ROLL: BMW logo, brand loyalty visual]**

> But I wanted a second opinion before dropping 35 grand. So I asked ChatGPT. I gave it my preferences - I wanted something fun to drive, good resale value, under a certain budget.

> ChatGPT came back and made a case I hadn't considered. It said: "Based on your preferences, you might want to consider a Porsche Boxster. Here's why - better driving dynamics than a comparable BMW, stronger resale value in the used market, and more unique ownership experience."

**[B-ROLL: ChatGPT response, Porsche Boxster beauty shot]**

**Framework Explanation:**
> Now think about what just happened. I didn't Google "Porsche vs BMW." I didn't read review websites. I didn't watch YouTube comparisons. I asked an AI, and the AI recommended a brand.

> This is what I call the "AI Recommendation Moment." It's happening millions of times a day, across every industry, for every type of purchase.

**[B-ROLL: Visual metaphor - branching decision tree with AI at the center]**

**Mini-Tension:**
> But here's where it gets interesting. If you're a car dealer, a hair clinic, a software company, a restaurant - how do you know if ChatGPT is recommending you? How do you know if you're the Porsche in your industry, or the brand that got passed over?

**Partial Resolution:**
> That question changed my entire business. I went from running ads and building funnels to something completely different - making sure my clients are the ones getting recommended.

---

## POINT 2: The Data That Changed Everything (4:30 - 7:00)

**Story/Example:**
> After the Porsche thing, I couldn't stop thinking about it. If AI changed my decision, what was it doing to my clients? So I went and audited my main project - a premium hair transplant clinic in the Netherlands that I'd helped scale from zero to ten million.

**[B-ROLL: Google SERP showing #3 ranking]**

> On paper, everything looked great. They ranked number 3 on Google for "best hair transplant Netherlands." Solid SEO. Page one. The kind of result most businesses would celebrate.

> But I wanted to know what was happening on the AI side. So I ran what I now call a "10-run consistency test." I asked ChatGPT and Gemini the same discovery queries - ten times each.

**[B-ROLL: Consistency test visualization, multiple query runs]**

**Framework Explanation:**
> Here's what I found. On Google - position 3, consistently. No change. The SEO was working exactly as expected.

> But on Gemini? For the most important discovery query - "best hair transplant clinic in the Netherlands" - they weren't mentioned AT ALL. Zero. Invisible.

**[B-ROLL: Two side-by-side charts - Google flat at #3, AI visibility showing gaps]**

> The clinic I'd spent years building had zero visibility on the exact query potential patients were asking AI assistants.

**[GIF: "so what?" shrug - then transition to realization]**

**Mini-Tension:**
> That's when I realized - Google rankings and AI visibility are two completely different games. You can win one and lose the other. And increasingly, the AI game is the one that matters for high-intent buyers.

**Partial Resolution:**
> So I optimized their content for AI - restructured the website copy, added citable facts in the first 50 words of every page, created comparison pages. Their Google ranking? Stayed exactly the same. Still number 3. But their Gemini visibility went from 0% to 70%. They started getting mentioned consistently.

**[B-ROLL: Chart showing 0% to 70% visibility spike]**

## POINT 3: What I Track Now (7:00 - 9:30)

**Story/Example:**
> So what do I actually look at now instead of Google rankings? Let me show you.

**[B-ROLL: Dashboard mockup showing AEO metrics]**

> Every week, I run consistency tests for my clients. I ask ChatGPT and Gemini their most important discovery queries - ten times each. And I track four things.

**Framework Explanation:**
> First: **Mention Rate**. Out of 10 queries, how many times does the brand get mentioned? Anything below 60% means you're being overlooked.

> Second: **Position**. When you ARE mentioned, are you first, third, fifth? Are you positioned as "the best" or just "one option"?

> Third: **Citation**. Does the LLM link back to your website? This tells you if your content is being used as a source.

> Fourth: **Context**. What does the AI say about you? Are they calling you "premium" or "budget"? "Best for hairlines" or "best for volume"? This is your AI reputation.

**[B-ROLL: Each metric visualized - mention rate pie chart, position ladder, citation links, context word cloud]**

**Build to Climax:**
> This is what I call AEO - Answer Engine Optimization. It's the new game. And the brands that figure this out now will dominate for the next decade.

> Think about it. Google had 20+ years of SEO best practices. Everyone learned the rules. Everyone competed on the same playing field.

> AI search is in year one. The rules are still being written. The businesses that move now get first-mover advantage.

**[GIF: Celebration/excitement reaction]**

## PAYOFF (9:30 - 11:00)

### Resolve Main Tension
> So, should you stop caring about Google rankings entirely?

> Not exactly. Google still drives traffic. SEO still matters. But it's no longer the ONLY thing that matters.

**[B-ROLL: Balance scale visual - Google on one side, AI on the other]**

### Deliver on Teaser
> Remember I said the Porsche changed everything? Here's what actually changed: my understanding of WHERE decisions are being made.

> When I bought that Boxster, the decision didn't happen on Google. It happened in a conversation with an AI. And that's happening for your customers too.

> The question isn't "where do you rank?" anymore. The question is "when someone asks AI about your industry, are you the brand that gets recommended?"

### Circle Back to Hook
> I went from checking Google rankings every morning to not checking them at all. Because I track something more important now - whether my clients show up when AI gives advice.

**[B-ROLL: Closing visual - person asking AI, brand appearing in response]**

## CTA (11:00 - 11:30)

### One-Sentence Recap
> So if you remember one thing from this video: Google rankings tell you where you rank. AI visibility tells you who gets chosen.

### Point to Next Video
> Watch this next video where I show you the exact system to get your brand recommended by ChatGPT and Gemini. Not theory - the actual step-by-step process I use with clients.
