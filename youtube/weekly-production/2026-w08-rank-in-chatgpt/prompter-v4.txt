[SLIDE 01: RANK #1 IN CHATGPT]

So a few months ago I was about to buy my third BMW. I'd had two before, loved them, was ready to just get another one.

But before I pulled the trigger, I asked ChatGPT. "Should I get another BMW or try something different?"

[SLIDE 02: PORSCHE STORY]

And ChatGPT talked me into a Porsche Boxster. Gave me all these reasons why it was a better fit. The driving experience, the value retention, the whole thing.

And I bought it. I literally changed a major purchase decision because of what an AI told me.

[SLIDE 03: THE REALIZATION]

And that's when it hit me. If ChatGPT can change MY buying decision - and I'm someone who researches everything - what's it doing to my clients' customers?

What's it doing to YOUR customers?

[SLIDE 04: THE INVISIBLE PROBLEM]

So I started testing. I asked ChatGPT for recommendations in different industries. Best CRM. Best marketing agency. Best hair transplant clinic. Whatever.

And here's what I found. Most businesses? ChatGPT has no idea they exist. They're completely invisible.

[SLIDE 05: COMPETITORS WINNING]

But their competitors? Getting recommended with glowing descriptions. ChatGPT is telling potential customers exactly why they should choose someone else.

It's like walking into a pitch meeting and the client already knows your competitor by name, but has never heard of you.

[SLIDE 06: THIS IS HAPPENING NOW]

And this isn't some future thing. 100 million people use ChatGPT every week. Right now. Asking for recommendations. Making decisions.

If you're not in those answers, you're losing business and you don't even know it.

[SLIDE 07: GOOGLE DOESN'T HELP]

Now you might be thinking, well I rank well on Google, I should be fine. Right?

Here's the thing. Your Google ranking has nothing to do with ChatGPT. I've seen companies ranking number one on Google that ChatGPT completely ignores.

[SLIDE 08: DIFFERENT GAME]

It's a completely different game. Different rules.

Think about it like this. Google is like a librarian who organizes books by popularity and links. ChatGPT is like a friend who's read everything and forms opinions based on what they actually trust.

Your friend doesn't care which book is on the front shelf. They care about which one is actually good.

[SLIDE 09: WHAT AI CARES ABOUT]

So what does ChatGPT actually care about when deciding who to recommend?

I've been obsessing over this. Testing it. And it comes down to three things.

[SLIDE 10: THING 1 - WHO YOU ARE]

First, it needs to know who you are. And I don't mean just your website.

Think about it. If someone asks you to recommend a restaurant, and you've only heard of it from one place, you're not that confident. But if you've seen it on Yelp, your friend mentioned it, it was in a magazine - now you trust it's real.

ChatGPT works the same way. Are you on Wikipedia? LinkedIn? Crunchbase? Industry directories? The more places you exist, the more it trusts you're legit.

[SLIDE 11: THING 2 - ARE YOU TRUSTED]

Second, are you actually trusted by other people?

ChatGPT doesn't just take your word for it that you're good. It looks for third-party validation. Press coverage. Reviews. Awards. People talking about you.

It's like hiring someone who says "I'm amazing at my job." Cool. But if three other people independently say the same thing - now you believe it.

[SLIDE 12: THING 3 - CAN AI READ YOU]

Third, can ChatGPT actually read your website?

Your homepage probably starts with some vague tagline like "Empowering businesses to reach their potential" or whatever. ChatGPT reads that and goes... okay but what do you actually do?

In the first 50 words, it needs: who you are, what you do, where you're located, price range. Clear facts. Not marketing fluff.

[SLIDE 13: 3 THINGS SUMMARY]

So that's it. Three things. Who you are across the internet. Whether others trust you. And whether AI can read your site.

But does this actually work? Let me show you.

[SLIDE 14: MY CLIENT - BEFORE]

So I had a client. FueGenix. Hair transplant clinic, premium service, great results, been around for years.

When we started, I asked ChatGPT "best hair transplant clinic, money no object." They weren't mentioned. Not once. Invisible.

[SLIDE 15: 8 WEEKS LATER]

8 weeks later, same question. Now they're the top recommendation. ChatGPT describes their technique, their expertise, why they're the best choice.

Not an ad. Not paid. ChatGPT just decided they were the answer.

[SLIDE 16: WHAT WE DID]

What did we do? Fixed those three things. Got them listed everywhere credible. Got them press coverage. Fixed their website so AI could actually read it.

8 weeks. Not years.

[SLIDE 17: HOW TO FIX IT]

So let me show you exactly what to do.

[SLIDE 18: STEP 1 - GET LISTED]

Step one, get listed everywhere that matters. Wikipedia if you qualify. Crunchbase. LinkedIn company page. Industry directories. Google Business Profile.

The goal is to exist as a verified entity across multiple trusted sources.

[SLIDE 19: STEP 2 - GET TRUSTED]

Step two, build trust signals. Get featured in industry publications. Collect reviews. Win awards if you can.

Remember - ChatGPT is checking if what you say about yourself matches what others say about you.

[SLIDE 20: STEP 3 - FIX YOUR SITE]

Step three, fix your website. First 50 words on every important page: who you are, what you do, where, and price range.

No vague taglines. Clear, extractable facts.

[SLIDE 21: STEP 4 - HELP AI READ YOU]

Step four, add structured data to your site. This is basically code that tells AI "here's my business name, here's what we do, here's our address" in a format it can easily read.

You don't need to know how to do this. Just tell your developer "add organization schema" and they'll know what to do. Takes an hour.

[SLIDE 22: STEP 5 - COMPARISONS]

Step five, create comparison pages. You versus your competitors.

AI loves clear comparisons. It helps it understand where you fit and why someone should choose you.

[SLIDE 23: THE SHIFT]

Here's the thing. The way people find businesses is changing. Fast.

I went from being a loyal BMW customer to buying a Porsche because of what an AI told me. Your customers are doing the same thing right now.

[SLIDE 24: THE TAKEAWAY]

So if you remember one thing: ChatGPT doesn't care about your Google ranking. It cares about who you are, whether you're trusted, and whether it can read your site.

Fix those three things.
