## Structure

### HOOK: PERSONAL STORY (0:00-1:00)

| Slide | What You Say |
|-------|--------------|
| 01 - RANK #1 IN CHATGPT | "So a few months ago I was about to buy my third BMW. I had two before, loved them, was ready to just go get another one. But before I pulled the trigger, I asked ChatGPT. 'Should I get another BMW or try something different this time?'" |
| 02 - PORSCHE STORY | "And ChatGPT talked me into getting a Porsche Boxster. Gave me all these reasons why it was the better fit. The driving experience, the value retention, the whole thing. And I bought it. I literally changed a major purchase decision because of what an AI told me." |
| 03 - THE REALIZATION | "And that's when it hit me. If ChatGPT can change my buying decision - and I'm someone who researches everything - what is it doing to my clients' customers? What is it doing to your customers?" |

### THE PROBLEM (1:00-2:30)

| Slide | What You Say |
|-------|--------------|
| 04 - THE INVISIBLE PROBLEM | "So I started testing. I asked ChatGPT for recommendations in different industries. Best CRM, best marketing agency, best hair transplant clinic, whatever. And here's what I found. In every industry, there's a handful of businesses getting recommended. And everyone else? Invisible. ChatGPT has no idea they exist." |
| 05 - COMPETITORS WINNING | "So the question is: which one are you? Are you the one getting recommended? Or are you invisible while someone else gets all the attention? And you have no idea this is happening. There's no ranking you can check. No analytics dashboard. Your competitor is winning deals before you even know you were in the running." |
| 06 - THIS IS HAPPENING NOW | "And this isn't some future thing. 100 million people are using ChatGPT every week right now, asking for recommendations and making buying decisions. If you're not in those answers, you're losing business and you don't even know it." |

### WHY GOOGLE DOESN'T WORK (2:30-4:00)

| Slide | What You Say |
|-------|--------------|
| 07 - GOOGLE DOESN'T HELP | "Now you might be thinking, well I rank well on Google, so I should be fine. Right? Well here's the thing. Your Google ranking has nothing to do with ChatGPT. I've seen companies ranking number one on Google that ChatGPT completely ignores. Doesn't even know that company exists." |
| 08 - DIFFERENT GAME | "It's a completely different game. Different rules. Think about it like this. Google is like a librarian who organizes books by popularity and links. ChatGPT is like a friend who's read everything and forms opinions based on what they actually trust. Your friend doesn't care which book is on the front shelf. They care about which one is actually good." |

### THE 3 THINGS (4:00-6:00)

| Slide | What You Say |
|-------|--------------|
| 09 - WHAT AI CARES ABOUT | "So what does ChatGPT actually care about when deciding who to recommend? I've been obsessing over this, testing it. And it comes down to three things." |
| 10 - THING 1: WHO YOU ARE | "First, it needs to know who you are. And I don't mean just your website. Think about it. If someone asks you to recommend a restaurant, and you've only heard of it from one place, you're not that confident. But if you've seen it on Yelp, your friend mentioned it, it was in a magazine - now you trust it's real. ChatGPT works the same way. Are you on Wikipedia? LinkedIn? Crunchbase? Industry directories? The more places you exist, the more it trusts you're legit." |
| 11 - THING 2: ARE YOU TRUSTED | "Second, are you actually trusted by other people? ChatGPT doesn't just take your word for it that you're good. It looks for third-party validation. Press coverage, reviews, awards, people talking about you. It's like hiring someone who says 'I'm amazing at my job.' Cool. But if three other people independently say the same thing - now you believe it." |
| 12 - THING 3: CAN AI READ YOU | "Third, can ChatGPT actually read your website? Your homepage probably starts with some vague tagline like 'Empowering businesses to reach their potential' or whatever. ChatGPT reads that and goes, okay, but what do you actually do? In the first 50 words, it needs to know: who you are, what you do, where you're located, price range. Clear facts. Not marketing fluff." |
| 13 - 3 THINGS SUMMARY | "So that's it. Three things. Who you are across the internet, whether others trust you, and whether AI can read your site. But does this actually work? Let me show you." |

### PROOF (6:00-7:30)

| Slide | What You Say |
|-------|--------------|
| 14 - MY CLIENT BEFORE | "So I had a client. FueGenix. Hair transplant clinic, premium service, great results, been around for years. Keep in mind, FueGenix charges 50k plus for a surgery. They're the most expensive clinic out there - more than double the next clinic below them. When we started, I asked ChatGPT 'what's the best hair transplant clinic if money is no object?' They weren't mentioned. Not once. Completely invisible." |
| 15 - 8 WEEKS LATER | "8 weeks later, same question. Now they're the top recommendation. Consistently. ChatGPT describes their technique, their expertise, why they're the best choice. This is not an ad, it's not paid. ChatGPT is introducing ads, but this has nothing to do with that. ChatGPT just decided they were the answer." |
| 16 - WHAT WE DID | "What did we do? Fixed those three things. Got them listed everywhere credible. Got them press coverage. Fixed their website so AI could actually read it. 8 weeks. Not years. This took 8 weeks and not years." |

### THE FIX (7:30-9:30)

| Slide | What You Say |
|-------|--------------|
| 17 - HOW TO FIX IT | "So how do you do the same thing for your business? Let me break it down step by step." |
| 18 - STEP 1: GET LISTED | "Step one, get listed everywhere that matters. Wikipedia if you qualify. Crunchbase. LinkedIn company page. Industry directories. Google Business Profile. The goal is to exist as a verified entity across multiple trusted sources." |
| 19 - STEP 2: GET TRUSTED | "Step two, build trust signals. Get featured in industry publications. Collect reviews. Win awards if you can. Remember - ChatGPT is checking if what you say about yourself matches what others say about you." |
| 20 - STEP 3: FIX YOUR SITE | "Step three, fix your website. First 50 words on every important page: who you are, what you do, where, and price range. No vague taglines. Clear, extractable facts." |
| 21 - STEP 4: HELP AI READ YOU | "Step four, add structured data to your site. This is basically code that tells AI 'here's my business name, here's what we do, here's our address' in a format it can easily read. You don't need to know how to do this. Just tell your developer 'add organization schema' and they'll know what to do. Takes about an hour." |
| 22 - STEP 5: COMPARISONS | "And step five, create comparison pages. You versus your competitors. AI loves clear comparisons. It helps it understand where you fit and why someone should choose you." |

### CALLBACK + CTA (9:30-end)

| Slide | What You Say |
|-------|--------------|
| 23 - WHY THIS MATTERS | "Now look, I know that sounds like a lot. But here's why it matters. The way people find businesses is changing. Fast. I went from being a loyal BMW customer to buying a Porsche because of what an AI told me. And now I'm completely obsessed with Porsches. Your customers are making decisions the same way right now. The question is: are you showing up when they ask?" |
| 24 - THE TAKEAWAY | "So that's it. ChatGPT doesn't care about your Google ranking. It cares about who you are, whether you're trusted, and whether it can read your website. Fix those three things and you will start showing up. It's not complicated. It just takes focus." |
| 25 - AEOPROTOCOL.AI | "Now if you want the complete framework - the full system I use with clients, the exact checklists, the tools, the whole process step by step - go to aeoprotocol dot ai. That's where I break down everything in detail." |
