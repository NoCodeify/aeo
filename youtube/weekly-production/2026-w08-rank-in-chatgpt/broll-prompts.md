## BROLL-01: ChatGPT Interface Tease

**Timestamp:** 0:25
**Supports:** "At minute 7, I'll show you a real brand..."
**Purpose:** Tease the climax reveal, create anticipation

### Prompt:

Elegant minimal illustration of a ChatGPT-style AI chat interface showing a brand recommendation, presented as a sophisticated UI mockup against a clean dark background. The visual teases a successful AI recommendation without revealing the full content.

BACKGROUND:
Solid deep navy-charcoal gradient (#1e2432 at top transitioning subtly to #171c26 at bottom). NO grid lines, NO texture, NO patterns. The background should be completely clean and uncluttered, creating a premium tech presentation feeling. The slight gradient adds depth without distraction.

COMPOSITION:
Centered chat interface mockup occupying approximately 60% of the frame width and 70% of frame height. The interface should float with generous margin on all sides. Position slightly above center (around 45% from top) to create visual stability.

THE CHAT INTERFACE:
A simplified, elegant representation of an AI chat interface. NOT a photorealistic screenshot - a clean, minimal interpretation.

Shape: Rounded rectangle with subtle corner radius (20-30px)
Fill: Very dark navy (#1a1f2a) with extremely subtle border (1px #2a3040)
No window chrome, no browser elements - just the chat area itself

CHAT CONTENT AREA:
Inside the interface, show a minimal conversation:

1. USER QUERY (top portion):
- Small user avatar placeholder: simple circle (#3a4050) on left
- Text suggestion: "Best [category] in Europe" in subtle gray (#6b7280)
- Clean, minimal styling

2. AI RESPONSE (main focus):
- AI avatar: simple geometric shape on left (subtle glow)
- Response area showing partial text with a brand name highlighted
- The brand name area should have a subtle warm gold (#c9a86c) underline or highlight
- Text should be partially visible, implying "recommended"
- Include a subtle checkmark or star icon near the brand mention

3. FOCAL TREATMENT:
- The brand recommendation area has a very subtle warm gold glow (#c9a86c at 8-10% opacity)
- Creates visual draw to the "success" without being garish

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Interface frame > Query > Response > Highlighted brand
- Story: AI is recommending a specific brand (the success state)
- Emotion: Anticipation, promise of the reveal to come

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Premium tech product launch
- Apple keynote screenshot

**Purpose:** Make the problem quantifiable and shocking

### Prompt:

Elegant minimal data visualization showing "53%" as a dominant statistic with supporting visual context, presented against a clean dark premium background. The visual communicates that more than half of businesses are invisible to AI.

BACKGROUND:
Solid deep navy-charcoal gradient (#1e2432 at top transitioning subtly to #171c26 at bottom). NO grid lines, NO texture, NO patterns. Completely clean and uncluttered, like a premium brand presentation.

COMPOSITION:
The layout uses the rule of thirds with the percentage as the dominant visual element. Left-center composition with supporting elements on the right.

MAIN ELEMENT - THE PERCENTAGE:
Position: Left side of frame, vertically centered
Size: Very large - "53" approximately 400px tall, "%" slightly smaller (300px)
Color: Soft silver-white (#e8eaed) for the numbers
Treatment: Clean, modern sans-serif numerals (not decorative)
A subtle warm gold (#c9a86c) accent - either an underline beneath "53%" or a thin vertical bar to the left

SUPPORTING VISUAL - BUSINESS ICONS:
Position: Right side of frame, arranged in a 5x2 grid (10 total icons)
Size: Each icon approximately 60-80px
Style: Simple building/company silhouettes (rectangle + triangle roof)

The grid shows:
- 5 buildings in ghosted gray (#4a5568) representing "invisible" businesses
- 5 buildings in solid silver-white (#e8eaed) representing "visible" businesses
- The split should be roughly 53/47 - so 5-6 ghosted vs 4-5 solid

Alternative: Instead of exact split, use crosshatch or fade effect on some buildings

LABEL TEXT:
Below the percentage: "INVISIBLE" in clean sans-serif
Color: Medium gray (#6b7280)
Size: 32-40px equivalent
Letter-spacing: slightly tracked out

Secondary label near building grid: "TO AI" in smaller text

A subtle warm gold (#c9a86c) glow or halo effect behind the number (12-15% opacity, large radius blur). Creates a "spotlight" effect suggesting importance.

LABEL TEXT:
Below the number: "WEEKLY USERS"
Two lines stacked:
- "WEEKLY" - larger, silver (#e8eaed)
- "USERS" - same size, silver (#e8eaed)
Alternative: "ASKING AI FOR RECOMMENDATIONS" in smaller gray text below

SUPPORTING VISUAL:
Below the text, a simple representation of scale:
