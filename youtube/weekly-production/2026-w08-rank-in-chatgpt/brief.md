## Stakes-Based Structure (NOT Logical Order)

**Order content by URGENCY, not logic. Each section should make viewers MORE anxious.**

### Section 1: Answer the Query (0:00-0:30)
**Search intent answer:** Entity establishment, trust signal optimization, and structured content. These three things determine whether ChatGPT recommends your brand or your competitor.
**Tension opener:** "But here's what 95% of businesses get wrong..."
**Tease climax:** "At minute 7, I'll show you a real brand that went from invisible to being ChatGPT's top recommendation."

### Section 2: You're Exposed (0:30-2:00)
**The problem is real:** Live demo querying ChatGPT about common industries (hair transplant clinics, CRM software, marketing agencies). Show how most brands are completely missing from responses.
**Visual proof:** Screen recording of ChatGPT queries with brands NOT appearing

### Section 3: It's Worse Than You Think (2:00-4:00)
**Escalate stakes:** 53% of businesses are completely invisible to AI. While you're not mentioned, your competitors ARE getting recommended. Every query is a lost customer.
**Visual proof:** 53% stat card, competitor mention screenshots

### Section 4: Here's Why (4:00-6:00)
**The insight:** How ChatGPT actually retrieves information - training data cutoff vs web search (SearchGPT) vs RAG patterns. Why traditional SEO doesn't translate.
**Visual:** 3-layer cache diagram (Training Data > Web Index > Real-time RAG)

### Section 5: The Climax (6:00-8:00)
**The "holy shit" moment:** Live demo of a brand (Fuegenix) that implemented AEO correctly. Query ChatGPT for "best hair transplant clinic in Europe" - watch them appear in the response with full context.
**Visual proof:** Before/after screen recordings showing transformation

### Section 6: The Fix (8:00-9:30)
**What to do:**
1. Entity establishment (Wikipedia, Crunchbase, industry directories)
2. Trust signal optimization (press coverage, awards, reviews on authoritative sites)
3. First 50 words rule (WHO/WHAT/WHERE/PRICE on every key page)
4. Schema.org markup (Organization, LocalBusiness, Product)
5. Content for AI extraction (comparison pages, FAQ schema, clear positioning)

### Section 7: CTA (9:30-end)
**Single takeaway:** ChatGPT doesn't care about your Google ranking. It cares about entity establishment, trust signals, and extractable content.
**CTA:** aeoprotocol.ai

## Mid-Video Climax (REQUIRED)

**Timestamp:** 6:00-8:00
**The reveal:** Live demonstration of brand appearing in ChatGPT response after AEO implementation

**Climax Checklist:**
- [x] Happens at 6:00-8:00 (not in hook)
- [x] Is VISUAL (show, don't tell)
- [x] Is SURPRISING (fast results, accessible method)
- [x] RESOLVES the tension built since minute 2
