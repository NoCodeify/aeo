1
00:00:00,621 --> 00:00:01,357
So a few months ago,

2
00:00:01,357 --> 00:00:02,925
I was about to buy my third BMW.

3
00:00:03,117 --> 00:00:04,205
I had two before,

4
00:00:04,525 --> 00:00:04,845
Love

5
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:05,245
them.

6
00:00:05,245 --> 00:00:07,277
 was ready to just go get another one.

7
00:00:07,405 --> 00:00:08,525
But before I pulled the trigger,

8
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:09,389
I asked Chat GPT

9
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:11,469
should I get another BMW or try something

10
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:12,269
different this time?

11
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,477
And Chat GPT talked me into getting a Porsche

12
00:00:14,477 --> 00:00:15,021
Boxster.

13
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:17,165
Gave me all these reasons why it was the better

14
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:17,517
fit,

15
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,349
the driving experience,

16
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,501
the value retention,

17
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:20,205
the whole thing.

18
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:21,301
And I bought it.

19
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:23,189
I literally changed a major purchase decision

20
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:24,789
because of what an AI told me.

21
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:26,165
And that's when it hit me.

22
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:28,181
If ChatGPT can change my buying decision

23
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,485
and I'm someone who researches everything,

24
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:32,085
what is it doing to my clients?

25
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:32,725
Customers?

26
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:34,645
What is it doing to your customers?

27
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:36,245
So I started testing.

28
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:38,741
I asked ChatGPT for recommendations in different

29
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:39,253
industries.

30
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:39,989
Best CRM,

31
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:41,173
 best marketing agency,

32
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:42,325
best hair transplant clinic,

33
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:42,925
whatever.

34
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,269
And here's what I found.

35
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:45,293
Most businesses,

36
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:47,341
ChatGPT has no idea they exist.

37
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:48,749
They're completely invisible.

38
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:51,053
But their competitors getting recommended with

39
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:51,949
glowing descriptions.

40
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:54,605
ChatGPT is telling potential customers exactly why

41
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:55,853
they should choose someone else.

42
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:57,517
It's like walking into a pitch meeting

43
00:00:57,965 --> 00:01:00,077
and the client already knows your competitor by

44
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:00,301
name,

45
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:01,613
but has never heard of you.

46
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:04,469
So,

47
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:05,301
side note here,

48
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:07,957
I would probably add a better explanation because

49
00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:09,013
this is still a bit confusing.

50
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:09,685
I don't get it.

51
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:11,085
And,

52
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:12,501
 this isn't some future thing.

53
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:13,397
There's a hundred,

54
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:15,860
there's 100 million people using Chat GPT every

55
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,661
week right now,

56
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,709
asking for recommendation and making buying

57
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:19,189
decisions.

58
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:20,533
If you're not in those answers,

59
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:22,677
you're losing business and you don't even know it.

60
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:23,029
Now,

61
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:23,765
you might be thinking,

62
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:24,269
well,

63
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:25,645
I rank well in Google,

64
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:26,669
so I should be fine,

65
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:26,925
right?

66
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:27,341
Well,

67
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:27,885
here's the thing.

68
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:29,613
Your Google ranking has nothing to do with

69
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:30,189
ChatGPT.

70
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:32,877
I've seen companies ranking number one on Google

71
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:35,437
that ChatGPT completely ignores and does not know

72
00:01:36,077 --> 00:01:37,485
whether that company even exists.

73
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:38,637
It's a completely different

74
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:39,405
game,

75
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:40,429
different rules.

76
00:01:40,557 --> 00:01:41,453
Think about it like this.

77
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:43,821
Google is like a librarian who organizes books by

78
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:44,781
popularity and links.

79
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:47,485
ChatGPT is like a friend who's read everything and

80
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:50,045
forms opinions based on what they actually trust.

81
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:52,189
Your friend doesn't care which book is on the

82
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:52,669
front shelf.

83
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:54,461
They care about which one is actually good.

84
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,477
So what does ChatGPT actually care about when

85
00:01:56,477 --> 00:01:57,916
deciding who to recommend?

86
00:01:58,237 --> 00:01:59,453
I've been obsessing over this,

87
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,029
testing it,

88
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:01,949
and it comes down to three things.

89
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:04,349
First is it needs to know who you are.

90
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:05,853
And I don't mean just your website.

91
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,837
Think about it.

92
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:08,565
If someone asks you to recommend a restaurant and

93
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,421
you've only heard of it from one place,

94
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:11,573
you're not that confident.

95
00:02:11,573 --> 00:02:12,853
But if you've seen it on Yelp,

96
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:13,685
your friend mentioned it,

97
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:14,965
it was in a magazine.

98
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,757
Now you trust that it's real.

99
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:18,805
ChatGPT works the same way.

100
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:19,829
Are you on Wikipedia,

101
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:20,181
LinkedIn,

102
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:20,853
Crunchbase,

103
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:22,133
industry directories?

104
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:23,669
The more places you exist,

105
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,461
the more it Trusts you're legit.

106
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:26,677
Second,

107
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:28,661
are you actually trusted by other people?

108
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:30,965
ChatGPT doesn't just take your word for it when

109
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:31,349
you're

110
00:02:31,677 --> 00:02:33,085
it looks for third party validation.

111
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:34,109
Press coverage,

112
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:34,813
reviews,

113
00:02:34,813 --> 00:02:35,261
awards,

114
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,541
people talking about you.

115
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:38,333
It's like hiring someone who says,

116
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:39,933
I'm amazing at my job,

117
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:40,541
cool.

118
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,357
But if three other people independently say the

119
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:43,581
same,

120
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:43,965
well,

121
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:44,925
now you believe it.

122
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:45,501
Third,

123
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:47,741
can ChatGPT actually read your website?

124
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:49,597
Your homepage probably starts with some

125
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:52,317
fake tagline like empowering businesses to reach

126
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:53,245
their potential or whatever.

127
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:54,885
ChatGPT reads that and goes,

128
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:55,269
well,

129
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:55,557
okay,

130
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:57,957
but what do you actually do in the first 50 words?

131
00:02:57,957 --> 00:02:59,013
It needs to know who you are,

132
00:02:59,013 --> 00:02:59,589
what you do,

133
00:02:59,589 --> 00:03:00,453
where you're located,

134
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:01,413
price range,

135
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:02,181
clear facts,

136
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,397
not marketing fluff.

137
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:04,357
So that's it.

138
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:04,933
Three things.

139
00:03:04,997 --> 00:03:06,532
Who you are across the Internet,

140
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:08,069
whether others trust you,

141
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,797
and whether AI can read your site.

142
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:11,333
But does this actually work?

143
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:11,717
Well,

144
00:03:11,717 --> 00:03:12,357
let me show you.

145
00:03:12,357 --> 00:03:13,317
So I had a client,

146
00:03:13,381 --> 00:03:14,853
a hair transplant clinic for Genyx

147
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:15,581
Premium service.

148
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:16,221
Great results,

149
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:17,181
been around for years.

150
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:18,013
When we started,

151
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:19,005
I asked you beauty,

152
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:20,541
what's the best hair transplant clinic?

153
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,173
If money is no object,

154
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:25,213
keep in mind Eugenics charges 50k plus for a

155
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:25,565
surgery.

156
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:25,885
They're,

157
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:27,741
they're the most expensive clinic out there,

158
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:30,941
like more than double the next clinic below them.

159
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:32,797
They weren't mentioned,

160
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:33,309
not once.

161
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:34,589
Completely invisible,

162
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:35,613
eight weeks later,

163
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:36,253
same question.

164
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:38,365
Now they're the top recommendation consistently.

165
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:40,237
Chatgpt describes their technique,

166
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:40,941
the expertise,

167
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:42,285
why they're the best choice.

168
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:43,725
It's this is not an ad,

169
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:44,461
it's not paid

170
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:45,069
well.

171
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:45,549
ChatGPT

172
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:46,861
is introducing ads,

173
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:48,237
but this has nothing to do with that.

174
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:50,669
ChatGPT just decided they were the answer.

175
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:51,949
So what did we do?

176
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:54,381
Fix those three things and got them listen

177
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:55,277
everywhere credible,

178
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:56,589
got them press coverage.

179
00:03:56,589 --> 00:03:58,733
Fix their website so AI could actually read it.

180
00:03:58,925 --> 00:03:59,501
Eight weeks,

181
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:00,141
not years.

182
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:02,853
This took eight weeks and not years.

183
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:04,325
So let me show you exactly what to do.

184
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:04,869
Step one,

185
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,245
get listed everywhere that matters.

186
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:07,525
Wikipedia qualify,

187
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:08,357
Crunchbase,

188
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:09,765
LinkedIn company page,

189
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:10,693
industry directories,

190
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:11,749
Google Business profile.

191
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:14,213
The goal is to exist as a verified entity across

192
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,333
multiple trusted sources.

193
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:16,709
And  step two,

194
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,829
build trust signals,

195
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,661
get featured in

196
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:19,877
industry publications,

197
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:20,965
collect reviews,

198
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:21,709
win awards.

199
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,285
If you can

200
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:22,925
remember,

201
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:25,005
ChatGPT is checking if what you say about yourself

202
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:26,509
matches what others say about you.

203
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:28,493
And step three is fix your website

204
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:29,197
first.

205
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,373
50 words on every important page.

206
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:31,949
Who you are,

207
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:32,589
what you do,

208
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:33,869
where and

209
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:35,085
price range.

210
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:36,717
No fake taglines.

211
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:38,093
Clear extractable facts.

212
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:38,797
Step four,

213
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,205
add structured data to your site.

214
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:42,221
This is basically code that tells AI,

215
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:43,085
here's my business name,

216
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:43,725
here's what we do,

217
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:44,301
here's our address

218
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:46,213
in a format it can easily read.

219
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:47,717
You don't need to know how to do this.

220
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:48,765
Just tell your developer,

221
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:48,909


222
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,509
add

223
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:51,653
organization schema and don't know what to do.

224
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:52,517
Takes about an hour.

225
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:53,605
Step five,

226
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:54,693
create comparison pages.

227
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:56,357
You versus your competitors.

228
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:58,085
AI loves clear comparisons.

229
00:04:58,085 --> 00:05:00,197
It helps it understand where you fit and why

230
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:01,221
someone should choose you

231
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:02,053
well.

232
00:05:02,565 --> 00:05:03,717
And here's the thing.

233
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:05,509
The way people find business is changing

234
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:06,213
fast.

235
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:08,997
I went from being a loyal BMW customer to buying a

236
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:10,565
Porsche because of what an AI told me,

237
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:12,549
and now I'm completely obsessed with Porsches.

238
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:14,917
Your customers are doing the same thing right now.

239
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:16,709
So if you remember one thing,

240
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,629
ChatGPT doesn't care about your Google ranking.

241
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,973
It cares about who you are,

242
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:20,933
whether you're trusted,

243
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:22,341
and whether it can read your.

244
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:23,173
Read your website.

245
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:24,133
Fix those three things.

246
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,053
And if you want the complete framework,

247
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:27,461
the full system I use with clients,

248
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,621
go to aeoprotocol AI.

249
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,181
So another side note,

250
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:37,429
sometimes I feel like

251
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:41,581
it jumps from one topic to the next way to ad,

252
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:42,165
 hoc.

253
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,957
For example,

254
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:44,629


255
00:05:45,365 --> 00:05:46,261
the takeaway,

256
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:48,701
it says,

257
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:50,045
fix those three things.

258
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:50,397
Yeah,

259
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:50,877
Then what?

260
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:53,821
And then it just jumps to cta.
