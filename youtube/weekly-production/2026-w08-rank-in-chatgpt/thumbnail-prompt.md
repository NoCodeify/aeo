## Imagen Prompt

Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style YouTube thumbnail on pure white background. PURE WHITE background #FFFFFF - NOT cream, NOT off-white. Bold hand-drawn text "#1 IN AI" as the hero element, large and dominant (taking up 40% of frame), slightly wobbly imperfect letters in dark charcoal (#1e1e1e) with orange-red (#E07A5F) circle drawn around it. Below or beside it, smaller hand-drawn text "GOOGLE" crossed out with a big wobbly X in orange-red. Simple hand-drawn stick figure on the right side pointing toward the text - confident pose, maybe with a small lightbulb or exclamation mark above their head. A few small radiating lines around "#1" suggesting importance/success. Hand-drawn arrow pointing from crossed-out "GOOGLE" to "#1 IN AI" showing the shift. All lines wobbly and imperfect like marker on whiteboard. Stroke weight 3-4px, casual sketch aesthetic. Feels like a founder explaining a key insight on a whiteboard. 1920x1080px YouTube thumbnail dimensions. AVOID: Perfect shapes, straight lines, polished typography, gradients, multiple colors beyond charcoal and orange-red, complex details, corporate aesthetic.
