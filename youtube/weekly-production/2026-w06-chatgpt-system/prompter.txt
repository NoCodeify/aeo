HOOK

Most people think ChatGPT just searches the web. It doesn't.

There are three layers between your brand and getting recommended. Most businesses never make it past layer one.

I've spent the last year auditing brands and figuring out how to crack all three.

Today I'm giving you the complete system - the exact steps I use with every client.

By the end, you'll know exactly why ChatGPT is ignoring you - and how to fix it this week.

SETUP

Here's what's actually happening when you ask ChatGPT a question.

You type "what's the best CRM for small businesses?" and ChatGPT gives you an answer. Feels like magic. Like it's searching the entire internet in real-time.

It's not.

ChatGPT is reading from a cache. A snapshot of information that was crawled days or weeks ago.

And here's the part nobody tells you: if your website isn't structured in a very specific way, that cache doesn't include you. At all.

So when someone asks ChatGPT for a recommendation in your category, you're not even in the running.

You haven't lost the race. You weren't invited to the race.

That's what I'm going to fix today. Let me show you the three layers - and exactly how to crack each one.

POINT 1: THE 3-LAYER ARCHITECTURE

Here's how ChatGPT actually retrieves information.

Layer 1: The Bing Index.

ChatGPT's web search is powered by Bing. So standard Bing SEO applies. If Bing can't find you, neither can ChatGPT.

This is where most people stop. They think: "I'm indexed in Google, I'm probably in Bing too." Maybe. Maybe not.

Layer 2: The OAI-SearchBot Index.

This is OpenAI's own crawler. It visits your site, reads your pages, and stores that information in a persistent cache.

Here's the key: this is where most citations come from. When ChatGPT recommends your brand and actually links to your website? That's Layer 2.

Layer 3: User-Triggered Fetches.

When someone asks ChatGPT about your brand specifically, it might fetch your site in real-time. This is the least reliable layer.

So here's the takeaway: Layer 2 is the game.

Most brands are stuck in Layer 1. They're indexed in Bing, but OAI-SearchBot either can't read their site or doesn't find anything worth caching.

And there's a specific reason for that. Which brings me to the most important rule in AEO.

POINT 2: THE FIRST 50 WORDS RULE

LLMs have a problem: they lose focus.

When an AI reads your website, it weights the beginning heavily. The first 50 words tell it WHO you are, WHAT you do, WHERE you operate, and your PRICE.

Most websites fail this immediately.

Here's a real example. Before:

"Unlock the power of natural restoration. Experience precision like never before. Our world-renowned approach delivers results that speak for themselves."

Sounds nice. Completely useless for AI.

Here's the after:

"FueGenix is an exclusive hair restoration clinic in the Netherlands. We serve high-net-worth individuals with a 99% graft survival rate. Investment from €50,000. One patient per day."

WHO: FueGenix, exclusive clinic.
WHAT: Hair restoration, 99% graft survival.
WHERE: Netherlands.
PRICE: €50,000.

Same brand. Completely different extractability.

When I audit websites, this is the first thing I check. Pull up your homepage right now. Read the first 50 words. Does it say WHO, WHAT, WHERE, and PRICE?

If not, you've got work to do.

POINT 3: THE 10-RUN CONSISTENCY TEST

Here's something that trips up almost everyone.

You ask ChatGPT "what's the best hair transplant clinic in Netherlands?" and your brand shows up. Great. Done, right?

Wrong.

LLM responses are non-deterministic. They vary every single time. You might appear in one response and not the next.

So I never test once. I test ten times.

Same query, ten runs. Then I count: how many times did the brand appear? What position? Was it cited?

Here's the scoring scale:

9-10 out of 10: You're locked in. Strong visibility.
7-8 out of 10: Good, but gaps to fix.
5-6 out of 10: Weak. You're appearing but inconsistent.
1-4 out of 10: Poor. Major work needed.
0 out of 10: Invisible. You don't exist to AI.

When I ran FueGenix's audit, they were 0 out of 10 on key queries. Zero.

30 days later, after implementing the system? 9 out of 10.

That's the difference between invisible and locked in.

But consistency isn't just about appearing. It's about appearing correctly. Which brings me to the next step.

POINT 4: THE HYBRID PAGE STRUCTURE

Here's how most websites are structured:

Big hero image. Marketing headline. Story about the founder. Testimonials. And somewhere at the bottom, maybe some actual facts.

LLMs read top to bottom. By the time they get to the facts, they've already moved on.

Here's the structure that actually works:

Above the Fold: Facts.

First 100-150 words: WHO, WHAT, WHERE, PRICE. Features. Outcomes. Numbers.

This is what LLMs extract. Put your most important information here.

Middle Section: Sales Copy.

Now you can tell your story. Your differentiators. Your testimonials. Humans read this. LLMs skim past it.

Bottom Section: Structured Data.

Features in bullet points. Pricing tables. FAQ section.

LLMs LOVE FAQs. They're pre-formatted question-and-answer pairs. Exactly how people ask ChatGPT questions.

Think of it like a sandwich. Facts on top, facts on bottom - that's what AI eats. Marketing in the middle for humans.

POINT 5: THE ORIGINAL DATA RULE

Here's why most content never gets cited.

LLMs don't cite generic advice. They already know generic advice. "Why AEO matters." "How to optimize your website." ChatGPT can generate that itself.

What they cite is unique data. Information they couldn't have known without reading your specific page.

Here's the rule: If ChatGPT could write it without you, it won't cite you.

So how do you create content that forces citations?

Original research. "We analyzed 500 ChatGPT responses and found..."

Proprietary data. "Our customers report an average 340% increase in..."

Specific case studies. "Here's what happened when we implemented this with FueGenix..."

When users ask ChatGPT a specific question - "What's the failure rate for hair transplants?" - and you're the only source with that data, the LLM HAS to cite you.

That's how you go from mentioned to cited. From recommended to linked.

PAYOFF

So let me bring this together.

The 3-Layer Stack: Understand how ChatGPT actually retrieves information. Layer 2 is the game.

The First 50 Words: WHO, WHAT, WHERE, PRICE - front-loaded on every key page.

The 10-Run Test: Never test once. Test ten times. Track consistency, not single responses.

The Hybrid Page: Facts above fold, marketing in middle, structured data at bottom.

Original Data: Create content ChatGPT couldn't write without you.

Remember at the beginning when I said most brands never make it past layer one?

Now you know why. And you know exactly how to fix it.

This isn't theory. This is the exact system I used to take a €50,000 clinic from zero visibility to being called "the best for artistic perfection" - globally.
