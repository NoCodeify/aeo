## HOOK TOURNAMENT

### Round 1: Generate 6 Hooks

**Hook 1: Controversial Statement**
```
Line 1: 90% of businesses are completely invisible to ChatGPT.
Line 2: I know this because I've audited over 100 brands. Same result every time.
Line 3: They've got the website, the SEO, the social proof - doesn't matter.
Line 4: Today I'm going to show you the exact system I use to fix this.
Line 5: There's one rule that changes everything - and nobody's talking about it.
```

**Hook 2: Surprising Statistic**
```
Line 1: When I test a brand in ChatGPT, I don't ask once. I ask ten times.
Line 2: Because here's what nobody tells you: ChatGPT gives different answers every single time.
Line 3: I've seen brands appear in 3 out of 10 responses. Not 10. Not zero. Three.
Line 4: In this video, I'll show you the exact system that gets you from inconsistent to locked in.
Line 5: Including why the first 50 words on your website might be killing your visibility.
```

**Hook 3: Provocative Question**
```
Line 1: What if I told you that ChatGPT has already made up its mind about your brand?
Line 2: It's not searching the web in real-time. It's reading from a cache - one that might be weeks old.
Line 3: And if your website doesn't follow one specific pattern, you'll never break in.
Line 4: Today I'll show you the exact system to get into that cache - and stay there.
Line 5: The last step is the one that actually forces ChatGPT to cite you.
```

**Hook 4: Specific Result**
```
Line 1: 30 days ago, my client was invisible in ChatGPT. Zero mentions.
Line 2: Today, Gemini calls them "the best for artistic perfection" - globally.
Line 3: This wasn't luck. It was a system.
Line 4: The same system I'm about to walk you through, step by step.
Line 5: And the part that matters most? It's not what you think.
```

**Hook 5: Relatable Frustration**
```
Line 1: You've done the SEO. You've got the reviews. Your website looks great.
Line 2: But when your ideal customer asks ChatGPT "what's the best [your category]?" - you're not there.
Line 3: I've seen this story a hundred times. The solution is simpler than you think.
Line 4: I'm going to show you the exact 5-step system that fixes this.
Line 5: The first step takes 10 minutes. And most people get it completely wrong.
```

**Hook 6: Contrarian Take**
```
Line 1: Most people think ChatGPT just searches the web. It doesn't.
Line 2: There are three layers between you and getting recommended. Most brands never make it past layer one.
Line 3: I've spent the last year figuring out how to crack all three.
Line 4: Today I'm going to give you the complete system - nothing held back.
Line 5: By the end, you'll know exactly why ChatGPT is ignoring you - and how to fix it.
```

### Round 2: Elimination (6 → 3)

**Matchup 1: Hook 1 vs Hook 4**
- Hook 1: Strong "90%" stat, but vague promise ("one rule")
- Hook 4: Specific result but feels like case study (Week 4 overlap)
- **Winner: Hook 1** - More universally applicable, better for deep dive

**Matchup 2: Hook 2 vs Hook 5**
- Hook 2: "10 times" stat is unique, introduces consistency concept, strong teaser
- Hook 5: Relatable but generic ("SEO, reviews, website")
- **Winner: Hook 2** - The 10-run angle is differentiated and creates curiosity

**Matchup 3: Hook 3 vs Hook 6**
- Hook 3: Cache concept is technical but intriguing
- Hook 6: "Three layers" is concrete and promises structure
- **Winner: Hook 6** - "Three layers" gives viewer a clear map of what's coming

---

### Round 3: Finals (3 → 1)

**Finalists: Hook 1, Hook 2, Hook 6**

**Evaluation:**

| Criteria | Hook 1 | Hook 2 | Hook 6 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Pattern Interrupt (40%) | Strong (90% stat) | Strong (10x testing) | Strong (three layers) |
| Curiosity Gap (30%) | Medium ("one rule") | Strong (first 50 words tease) | Very Strong (crack all three) |
| Goal Alignment (20%) | Good | Strong | Very Strong |
| Teaser Power (10%) | Weak (vague) | Strong (first 50 words) | Strong (why ignoring + how to fix) |

**WINNER: Hook 6 (Contrarian Take)**

**Why Hook 6 wins:**
- "Three layers" gives structure and makes viewer want to learn all three
- "Never make it past layer one" creates immediate tension
- "Nothing held back" signals completeness (matches "EXACT System" promise)
- "Why ignoring you - and how to fix it" is the perfect problem → solution tease
- Sets up the architecture explanation that's central to the video

**Improved Hook 6:**
```
Line 1: Most people think ChatGPT just searches the web. It doesn't.
Line 2: There are three layers between your brand and getting recommended. Most never make it past layer one.
Line 3: I've spent the last year auditing brands and figuring out how to crack all three.
Line 4: Today I'm giving you the complete system - the exact steps I use with every client.
Line 5: By the end, you'll know exactly why ChatGPT is ignoring you - and how to fix it this week.
```

## FINAL SCRIPT

### === HOOK (0:00 - 0:45) ===

Most people think ChatGPT just searches the web. It doesn't.

There are three layers between your brand and getting recommended. Most businesses never make it past layer one.

**[VISUAL: 3-layer diagram teaser - layers grayed out]**

I've spent the last year auditing brands and figuring out how to crack all three.

Today I'm giving you the complete system - the exact steps I use with every client.

**[VISUAL: "The Complete System" title card]**

By the end, you'll know exactly why ChatGPT is ignoring you - and how to fix it this week.

---

### === SETUP: THE PROBLEM (0:45 - 2:00) ===

Here's what's actually happening when you ask ChatGPT a question.

You type "what's the best CRM for small businesses?" and ChatGPT gives you an answer. Feels like magic. Like it's searching the entire internet in real-time.

**[VISUAL: ChatGPT interface with query]**

It's not.

ChatGPT is reading from a cache. A snapshot of information that was crawled days or weeks ago.

**[GIF: "Wait what?" reaction]**

And here's the part nobody tells you: if your website isn't structured in a very specific way, that cache doesn't include you. At all.

**[VISUAL: Website being rejected from cache]**

So when someone asks ChatGPT for a recommendation in your category, you're not even in the running.

You haven't lost the race. You weren't invited to the race.

That's what I'm going to fix today. Let me show you the three layers - and exactly how to crack each one.

---

### === POINT 1: THE 3-LAYER ARCHITECTURE (2:00 - 4:00) ===

**The Framework: "The 3-Layer Stack"**

Here's how ChatGPT actually retrieves information.

**[VISUAL: 3-layer diagram building up]**

**Layer 1: The Bing Index.**

ChatGPT's web search is powered by Bing. So standard Bing SEO applies. If Bing can't find you, neither can ChatGPT.

This is where most people stop. They think: "I'm indexed in Google, I'm probably in Bing too." Maybe. Maybe not.

**Layer 2: The OAI-SearchBot Index.**

This is OpenAI's own crawler. It visits your site, reads your pages, and stores that information in a persistent cache.

**[VISUAL: OAI-SearchBot crawling website]**

Here's the key: this is where most citations come from. When ChatGPT recommends your brand and actually links to your website? That's Layer 2.

**Layer 3: User-Triggered Fetches.**

When someone asks ChatGPT about your brand specifically, it might fetch your site in real-time. This is the least reliable layer.

**[VISUAL: Complete 3-layer stack diagram]**

So here's the takeaway: Layer 2 is the game.

Most brands are stuck in Layer 1. They're indexed in Bing, but OAI-SearchBot either can't read their site or doesn't find anything worth caching.

**[GIF: Lightbulb moment]**

And there's a specific reason for that. Which brings me to the most important rule in AEO.

---

### === POINT 2: THE FIRST 50 WORDS RULE (4:00 - 5:45) ===

**The Framework: "The First 50 Words Rule"**

LLMs have a problem: they lose focus.

When an AI reads your website, it weights the beginning heavily. The first 50 words tell it WHO you are, WHAT you do, WHERE you operate, and your PRICE.

**[VISUAL: "WHO / WHAT / WHERE / PRICE" framework]**

Most websites fail this immediately.

Here's a real example. Before:

"Unlock the power of natural restoration. Experience precision like never before. Our world-renowned approach delivers results that speak for themselves."

**[VISUAL: Red X over fluffy copy]**

Sounds nice. Completely useless for AI.

Here's the after:

"FueGenix is an exclusive hair restoration clinic in the Netherlands. We serve high-net-worth individuals with a 99% graft survival rate. Investment from €50,000. One patient per day."

**[VISUAL: Green checkmark over factual copy]**

WHO: FueGenix, exclusive clinic.
WHAT: Hair restoration, 99% graft survival.
WHERE: Netherlands.
PRICE: €50,000.

**[VISUAL: Each element being highlighted]**

Same brand. Completely different extractability.

**[GIF: Chef's kiss]**

When I audit websites, this is the first thing I check. Pull up your homepage right now. Read the first 50 words. Does it say WHO, WHAT, WHERE, and PRICE?

If not, you've got work to do.

---

### === POINT 3: THE 10-RUN CONSISTENCY TEST (5:45 - 7:30) ===

**The Framework: "The 10-Run Consistency Test"**

Here's something that trips up almost everyone.

You ask ChatGPT "what's the best hair transplant clinic in Netherlands?" and your brand shows up. Great. Done, right?

Wrong.

**[VISUAL: Single query result]**

LLM responses are non-deterministic. They vary every single time. You might appear in one response and not the next.

So I never test once. I test ten times.

**[VISUAL: 10-run consistency test grid]**

Same query, ten runs. Then I count: how many times did the brand appear? What position? Was it cited?

**[VISUAL: Scoring grid filling in]**

Here's the scoring scale:

9-10 out of 10: You're locked in. Strong visibility.
7-8 out of 10: Good, but gaps to fix.
5-6 out of 10: Weak. You're appearing but inconsistent.
1-4 out of 10: Poor. Major work needed.
0 out of 10: Invisible. You don't exist to AI.

**[VISUAL: Consistency scoring scale]**

When I ran FueGenix's audit, they were 0 out of 10 on key queries. Zero.

30 days later, after implementing the system? 9 out of 10.

**[VISUAL: 0/10 → 9/10 progress animation]**

That's the difference between invisible and locked in.

**[GIF: Mind blown]**

But consistency isn't just about appearing. It's about appearing correctly. Which brings me to the next step.

---

### === POINT 4: THE HYBRID PAGE STRUCTURE (7:30 - 9:00) ===

**The Framework: "The Hybrid Page Structure"**

Here's how most websites are structured:

Big hero image. Marketing headline. Story about the founder. Testimonials. And somewhere at the bottom, maybe some actual facts.

**[VISUAL: Traditional website layout]**

LLMs read top to bottom. By the time they get to the facts, they've already moved on.

Here's the structure that actually works:

**[VISUAL: Hybrid page structure diagram]**

**Above the Fold: Facts.**

First 100-150 words: WHO, WHAT, WHERE, PRICE. Features. Outcomes. Numbers.

This is what LLMs extract. Put your most important information here.

**Middle Section: Sales Copy.**

Now you can tell your story. Your differentiators. Your testimonials. Humans read this. LLMs skim past it.

**[VISUAL: Middle section labeled "For Humans"]**

**Bottom Section: Structured Data.**

Features in bullet points. Pricing tables. FAQ section.

**[VISUAL: FAQ section highlighted]**

LLMs LOVE FAQs. They're pre-formatted question-and-answer pairs. Exactly how people ask ChatGPT questions.

**[GIF: "This is brilliant"]**

Think of it like a sandwich. Facts on top, facts on bottom - that's what AI eats. Marketing in the middle for humans.

---

### === POINT 5: THE ORIGINAL DATA RULE (9:00 - 10:30) ===

**The Framework: "The Original Data Rule"**

Here's why most content never gets cited.

LLMs don't cite generic advice. They already know generic advice. "Why AEO matters." "How to optimize your website." ChatGPT can generate that itself.

**[VISUAL: Generic content with "NO CITATION" stamp]**

What they cite is unique data. Information they couldn't have known without reading your specific page.

**[VISUAL: Research report with citation arrow]**

Here's the rule: If ChatGPT could write it without you, it won't cite you.

So how do you create content that forces citations?

**Original research.** "We analyzed 500 ChatGPT responses and found..."

**Proprietary data.** "Our customers report an average 340% increase in..."

**Specific case studies.** "Here's what happened when we implemented this with FueGenix..."

**[VISUAL: "N=500 Study" research report mockup]**

When users ask ChatGPT a specific question - "What's the failure rate for hair transplants?" - and you're the only source with that data, the LLM HAS to cite you.

That's how you go from mentioned to cited. From recommended to linked.

**[GIF: Pointing at camera "you got this"]**

---

### === PAYOFF (10:30 - 11:15) ===

So let me bring this together.

**[VISUAL: "The Complete System" summary card]**

The 3-Layer Stack: Understand how ChatGPT actually retrieves information. Layer 2 is the game.

The First 50 Words: WHO, WHAT, WHERE, PRICE - front-loaded on every key page.

The 10-Run Test: Never test once. Test ten times. Track consistency, not single responses.

The Hybrid Page: Facts above fold, marketing in middle, structured data at bottom.

Original Data: Create content ChatGPT couldn't write without you.

**[VISUAL: 5 steps with checkmarks]**

Remember at the beginning when I said most brands never make it past layer one?

Now you know why. And you know exactly how to fix it.

This isn't theory. This is the exact system I used to take a €50,000 clinic from zero visibility to being called "the best for artistic perfection" - globally.

**[VISUAL: FueGenix result quote]**
