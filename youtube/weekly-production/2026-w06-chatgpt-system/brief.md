## Key Points to Cover

1. **The 3-Layer Architecture**
   - Story/example: "Most people think ChatGPT just searches the web. It doesn't."
   - Visual metaphor: 3-tier cake diagram (Bing → OAI-SearchBot → User fetches)

2. **The First 50 Words Rule**
   - Story/example: Before/after of FueGenix homepage opening
   - Visual metaphor: Highlighter marking first paragraph, truncation scissors

3. **The 10-Run Consistency Test**
   - Story/example: "I asked ChatGPT the same question 10 times. Got different answers every time."
   - Visual metaphor: Slot machine showing different results, consistency scorecard

4. **The Hybrid Page Structure**
   - Story/example: Website wireframe showing facts above fold, sales copy middle, FAQ bottom
   - Visual metaphor: Sandwich diagram (LLM extracts top + bottom, skims middle)

5. **The Original Data Rule**
   - Story/example: "LLMs don't cite generic advice. They cite unique data."
   - Visual metaphor: Research report with citation arrow, "N=500 Study"
