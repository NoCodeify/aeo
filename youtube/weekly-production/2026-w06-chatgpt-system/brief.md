## Video Concept

**Title:** "If I Had To Rebuild My Business In 2026, I'd Do This First"

**Why this title works:**
- Universal hook: Everyone thinks about "what would I do if starting over?"
- Hypothetical frame makes it feel like insider advice
- Year adds urgency/relevance (2026 = NOW)
- Curiosity: What's the ONE thing he'd prioritize?

**OLD Title (killed):** "The EXACT System To Get Your Brand Recommended by ChatGPT"
- Process-focused (YOUR system, not THEIR problem)
- Jargon-forward (ChatGPT in title)
- No emotional hook

**Thumbnail Concept:**
- Text: "DO THIS FIRST"
- Face/emotion: Serious, direct eye contact, pointing gesture
- Visual metaphor: Arrow or "STEP 1" badge
- Background: Dark navy (#0A1628)
- Text color: Electric Yellow (#FFE135), bold

**1+1=3 Check:**
- Title = hypothetical scenario (if rebuilding, what first?)
- Thumbnail = urgency/priority (DO THIS FIRST)
- Together = "There's one critical thing to prioritize - I need to know"

**Angle:** This is the complete system - not tips, not theory. The actual methodology that gets brands from invisible to cited.

**Type:** [X] Deep Dive

---

## Target Audience

**Who is this for:**
- Stage: Aware of AI search but don't know how to optimize for it
- Problem they have: Competitors show up in ChatGPT, they don't
- What they've tried: Traditional SEO, maybe asked ChatGPT about their brand

**Why they'll click:** "If starting over" frame is universally compelling + implied insider knowledge

**Why they'll stay:** Each point builds on the last. Tension: "Most brands make a critical mistake in the first 50 words..."

## Key Points to Cover

1. **The 3-Layer Architecture**
   - Story: "Most people think ChatGPT just searches the web. It doesn't."
   - Visual: 3-tier cake diagram (Bing, OAI-SearchBot, User fetches)

2. **The First 50 Words Rule**
   - Story: Before/after of FueGenix homepage opening
   - Visual: Highlighter marking first paragraph, truncation scissors

3. **The 10-Run Consistency Test**
   - Story: "I asked ChatGPT the same question 10 times. Got different answers every time."
   - Visual: Slot machine showing different results, consistency scorecard

4. **The Hybrid Page Structure**
   - Story: Website wireframe showing facts above fold, sales copy middle, FAQ bottom
   - Visual: Sandwich diagram (LLM extracts top + bottom)

5. **The Original Data Rule**
   - Story: "LLMs don't cite generic advice. They cite unique data."
   - Visual: Research report with citation arrow

## Proof Elements

**Numbers to share:**
- FueGenix: 0% to 90% visibility in 30 days

## Title & Thumbnail Validation (DO NOT SKIP)

### Universal Hook Check (MOST CRITICAL)

**The Question:** Would a business owner who has NEVER heard of AEO stop scrolling for this?

**Answer:** YES - "If starting over in 2026" speaks to EVERYONE running a business.

### Title Options:

1. "If I Had To Rebuild My Business In 2026, I'd Do This First" - WINNER
2. "The One Thing I'd Prioritize If Starting A Business In 2026"

4. "What I'd Do Differently If I Rebuilt My Business Today"

**Winner:** "If I Had To Rebuild My Business In 2026, I'd Do This First"
