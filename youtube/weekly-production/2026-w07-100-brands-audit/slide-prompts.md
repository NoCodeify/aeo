## SLIDE-01: Stripe Reveal

**Timestamp:** Hook (0:00-0:30)
**Type:** Reveal/Shock
**Supports:** "Stripe is a $100B company but ChatGPT doesn't mention them"

### Prompt:

Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style diagram showing a shocking reveal about Stripe's AI invisibility. The style mimics Excalidraw - imperfect hand-drawn lines, wobbly shapes, handwritten text, casual sketch aesthetic like someone quickly drew this on a whiteboard to make a dramatic point.

BACKGROUND:
Clean white or very light cream background (#FFFFFF). NO gradients, NO textures, NO grid lines. Empty whiteboard feel.

OVERALL STYLE - EXCALIDRAW AESTHETIC:
- Lines slightly wobbly, not perfectly straight
- Shapes imperfect - rectangles aren't quite rectangular
- Corners don't quite meet perfectly
- "Sketched quickly" quality
- Stroke weight consistent (2-3px equivalent)
- Lines have slight hand-tremor quality
- Text looks handwritten, slightly uneven baseline
- Feeling: casual, authentic, human, NOT polished

LINE QUALITY:
All strokes hand-drawn:
- Slight waviness
- Varying pressure
- Endpoints don't quite connect
- "Drawn with a marker" feel
- Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e)
- Stroke weight: Medium

COMPOSITION:
Split layout with dramatic reveal. Left side takes 45% showing impressive success indicators. Center has a dramatic "BUT" divider taking 10%. Right side takes 45% showing the shocking reality with crossed-out elements.

ELEMENT 1 - STRIPE SUCCESS (Left Side):
A simple hand-drawn building or office tower sketch representing Stripe, positioned in the upper-left quadrant. Below it, a large hand-drawn "$100B" in bold, slightly wobbly numerals approximately 150px tall. The dollar sign should be exaggerated and hand-drawn. Below the valuation, small success indicators: upward arrows, star shapes, and a simple money bag icon. All drawn with confident but imperfect strokes. A small label "STRIPE" in handwritten capitals sits above the building. Include 2-3 radiating lines around the building suggesting importance/success.

ELEMENT 2 - THE DRAMATIC DIVIDER (Center):
A vertical hand-drawn dividing line running from top to bottom of the frame, slightly wobbly. In the middle of this line, the word "BUT" written in large handwritten capitals (approximately 80px tall). The word should be circled or have a rough box around it to emphasize the pivot. This element creates the dramatic tension between success and reality.

ELEMENT 3 - CHATGPT REALITY (Right Side):
At the top right, a simple chat bubble icon with "ChatGPT" written inside in handwritten text. Below this, a search or query indicator showing "best payment platform" in smaller handwritten text with a question mark. The main shocking element: a large "0" (approximately 200px tall) drawn with thick, hand-drawn strokes. Below the zero, the word "MENTIONS" in handwritten capitals with the orange-red accent color (#E07A5F) as an underline. A large hand-drawn X mark crosses through the Stripe name or logo area on this side, drawn in the orange-red accent color to emphasize the absence.

ELEMENT 4 - VISUAL CONTRAST INDICATORS:
On the left side, small checkmarks and plus signs scattered to indicate success. On the right side, dashed lines and question marks to indicate absence/confusion. A hand-drawn arrow curves from the $100B on the left pointing toward the 0 on the right, with a question mark next to it suggesting "how is this possible?"

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
The orange-red (#E07A5F) appears in exactly two places: the X mark crossing out Stripe on the right side, and the underline beneath "MENTIONS". This creates the visual punch of the reveal without overusing the accent.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Building/Success → "BUT" → Zero mentions
- Story: Even massive success doesn't guarantee AI visibility
- Emotion: Shock, disbelief, "wait, what?"

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Should feel like a founder explaining something shocking
- Like discovering your biggest competitor has a secret weakness
- The "holy shit" moment that hooks the viewer

## SLIDE-02: 53% Invisible

**Timestamp:** Setup (0:30-1:00)
**Type:** Big Stat
**Supports:** "53% of 100 brands audited were invisible to AI"

### Prompt:

Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style diagram showing a dominant statistic about AI invisibility. The style mimics Excalidraw - imperfect hand-drawn lines, wobbly shapes, handwritten text, casual sketch aesthetic like someone quickly drew this on a whiteboard to emphasize a shocking finding.

BACKGROUND:
Clean white or very light cream background (#FFFFFF). NO gradients, NO textures, NO grid lines. Empty whiteboard feel.

OVERALL STYLE - EXCALIDRAW AESTHETIC:
- Lines slightly wobbly, not perfectly straight
- Shapes imperfect - rectangles aren't quite rectangular
- Corners don't quite meet perfectly
- "Sketched quickly" quality
- Stroke weight consistent (2-3px equivalent)
- Lines have slight hand-tremor quality
- Text looks handwritten, slightly uneven baseline
- Feeling: casual, authentic, human, NOT polished

LINE QUALITY:
All strokes hand-drawn:
- Slight waviness
- Varying pressure
- Endpoints don't quite connect
- "Drawn with a marker" feel
- Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e)
- Stroke weight: Medium

COMPOSITION:
Centered layout with the statistic as the dominant visual element. The number takes up approximately 40% of the frame height, positioned slightly above center. Supporting elements frame the number without competing for attention.

ELEMENT 1 - ROW OF BUILDINGS (Top):
A horizontal row of 10 simple hand-drawn building sketches across the top portion of the frame, representing the 100 brands (each building = 10 brands). Simple rectangle + triangle roof shapes, varying slightly in height (some 60px, some 80px tall). Spaced evenly with small gaps. The leftmost 5 buildings (representing the 53% invisible) should be drawn with dashed/dotted lines to indicate invisibility. The rightmost 5 buildings drawn with solid lines. This visual immediately shows the proportion without needing to read the number.

ELEMENT 2 - THE DOMINANT NUMBER (Center):
Massive hand-drawn "53%" positioned in the center of the frame. The numerals should be approximately 300px tall, drawn with thick, confident strokes that are slightly wobbly. The "5" and "3" should have that hand-drawn quality where the curves aren't perfect. The "%" symbol slightly smaller (200px) positioned to the right and slightly elevated. A hand-drawn rough circle or oval surrounds the entire "53%" in the orange-red accent color (#E07A5F), not a perfect circle but a quick, sketchy encirclement that emphasizes this is the key number.

ELEMENT 3 - SUPPORTING LABEL (Below Number):
Below the 53%, the word "INVISIBLE" in large handwritten capitals (approximately 80px tall). Below that, smaller text "to AI" in handwritten style (40px). The word "INVISIBLE" should have a single underline in the standard charcoal color. Optionally, small dashed lines radiating outward from the word to suggest the concept of invisibility/disappearing.

ELEMENT 4 - CONTEXT INDICATOR (Bottom):
At the bottom of the frame, a small annotation: "100 brands audited" with a simple tally mark representation (five groups of four marks with a diagonal = 20 marks representing 100 in shorthand, or simply "100" with a small building icon). This grounds the statistic in the research. Drawn smaller and in a lighter gray (#999999) so it doesn't compete with the main number.

ELEMENT 5 - VISUAL METAPHOR ELEMENTS:
Around the edges of the frame, small sketched elements suggesting invisibility: a few dotted outlines of shapes, a ghost-like simple figure (circle head, wavy body outline made of dashes), or an eye with a line through it. These should be subtle, positioned in corners, drawn in the secondary gray (#999999).

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
The orange-red (#E07A5F) is used only for the rough circle/oval surrounding the "53%" number. This single accent draws the eye immediately to the key statistic.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Buildings (context) → 53% (shock) → INVISIBLE (meaning)
- Story: More than half of all brands simply don't exist to AI
- Emotion: Alarm, urgency, "this could be me"

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Should feel like a wake-up call
- Like seeing your test results and realizing you failed
- The moment of "I need to pay attention to this"

THIS SHOULD NOT FEEL LIKE:

## SLIDE-03: Category Rankings

**Timestamp:** Section 1 (1:00-2:00)
**Type:** Bar Chart
**Supports:** "Categories ranked: Consulting 80%, SaaS 70%, Education 70%, Healthcare 10%"

### Prompt:

Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style horizontal bar chart showing AI visibility rates across 10 industry categories. The style mimics Excalidraw - imperfect hand-drawn lines, wobbly shapes, handwritten text, casual sketch aesthetic like someone quickly drew this on a whiteboard to compare performance across categories.

BACKGROUND:
Clean white or very light cream background (#FFFFFF). NO gradients, NO textures, NO grid lines. Empty whiteboard feel.

OVERALL STYLE - EXCALIDRAW AESTHETIC:
- Lines slightly wobbly, not perfectly straight
- Shapes imperfect - rectangles aren't quite rectangular
- Corners don't quite meet perfectly
- "Sketched quickly" quality
- Stroke weight consistent (2-3px equivalent)
- Lines have slight hand-tremor quality
- Text looks handwritten, slightly uneven baseline
- Feeling: casual, authentic, human, NOT polished

LINE QUALITY:
All strokes hand-drawn:
- Slight waviness
- Varying pressure
- Endpoints don't quite connect
- "Drawn with a marker" feel
- Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e)
- Stroke weight: Medium

COMPOSITION:
Horizontal bar chart layout with category labels on the left and bars extending to the right. The chart occupies most of the frame with generous margins. Categories are stacked vertically from top (best) to bottom (worst), creating a visual ranking. Title at top, bars in middle, no axis numbers or gridlines.

ELEMENT 1 - CHART TITLE (Top):
At the top of the frame, hand-drawn text "VISIBILITY BY CATEGORY" in handwritten capitals (approximately 50px tall). Below it, a small subtitle "% of brands AI mentions" in smaller handwritten text (25px). A rough underline beneath the title, slightly wavy.

ELEMENT 2 - CATEGORY LABELS (Left Column):
Ten category names stacked vertically on the left side, each in handwritten text (approximately 30px). From top to bottom: "Consulting", "SaaS", "Education", "Finance", "E-commerce", "Agencies", "Local", "Real Estate", "Retail", "Healthcare". Each label right-aligned with consistent spacing (approximately 80px between each row). The labels are drawn in standard charcoal (#1e1e1e).

ELEMENT 3 - HORIZONTAL BARS (Center-Right):
Ten horizontal bars extending from left to right, each bar corresponding to a category. Bar heights approximately 50px each with 30px gaps between them. Bar lengths proportional to percentages:
- Consulting: 80% of max width (longest bar)
- SaaS: 70% of max width
- Education: 70% of max width
- Finance: 60% of max width
- E-commerce: 50% of max width
- Agencies: 40% of max width
- Local: 40% of max width
- Real Estate: 30% of max width
- Retail: 20% of max width
- Healthcare: 10% of max width (shortest bar)

Each bar is a hand-drawn rectangle with wobbly edges, not perfectly filled. The bars are outlined in charcoal (#1e1e1e) with a light fill (use hatching or diagonal lines inside rather than solid fill to maintain the sketch aesthetic).

ELEMENT 4 - PERCENTAGE LABELS:
At the end of each bar (just to the right of the bar), the percentage written in handwritten numerals: "80%", "70%", "70%", "60%", "50%", "40%", "40%", "30%", "20%", "10%". Each approximately 25px in size.

ELEMENT 5 - HIGHLIGHT ELEMENTS:
The top bar (Consulting 80%) has a small star or checkmark next to it drawn in standard charcoal. The bottom bar (Healthcare 10%) is highlighted with the orange-red accent color (#E07A5F) - either the bar outline is in orange, or there's a rough circle around the "10%" or an exclamation mark next to it. This draws attention to the worst performer.

ELEMENT 6 - VISUAL INDICATORS:
A hand-drawn arrow on the right side pointing downward with "WORSE" written next to it in small handwritten text. At the top, a small upward arrow with "BETTER" written next to it. These help orient the viewer to the ranking direction.

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
The orange-red (#E07A5F) is used only on the Healthcare bar or its percentage to highlight the worst performer. This single accent point emphasizes the category that's struggling most.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Title → Top bars (winners) → Bottom bar (loser)
- Story: Some industries dominate AI visibility, others are invisible
- Emotion: Competitive comparison, "where does my industry rank?"

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Should feel like a leaderboard
- Like checking sports standings
- Clear winners and losers at a glance

## SLIDE-04: 8x Gap

**Timestamp:** Section 1 (2:00-2:30)
**Type:** Comparison Stat
**Supports:** "8x gap between best and worst performing categories"

### Prompt:

Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style diagram showing a dramatic comparison between the best and worst performing categories. The style mimics Excalidraw - imperfect hand-drawn lines, wobbly shapes, handwritten text, casual sketch aesthetic like someone quickly drew this on a whiteboard to emphasize the massive gap.

BACKGROUND:
Clean white or very light cream background (#FFFFFF). NO gradients, NO textures, NO grid lines. Empty whiteboard feel.

OVERALL STYLE - EXCALIDRAW AESTHETIC:
- Lines slightly wobbly, not perfectly straight
- Shapes imperfect - rectangles aren't quite rectangular
- Corners don't quite meet perfectly
- "Sketched quickly" quality
- Stroke weight consistent (2-3px equivalent)
- Lines have slight hand-tremor quality
- Text looks handwritten, slightly uneven baseline
- Feeling: casual, authentic, human, NOT polished

LINE QUALITY:
All strokes hand-drawn:
- Slight waviness
- Varying pressure
- Endpoints don't quite connect
- "Drawn with a marker" feel
- Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e)
- Stroke weight: Medium

COMPOSITION:
Classic left-center-right comparison layout. Left side (40% of frame) shows the winner. Center (20%) shows the dramatic multiplier. Right side (40%) shows the loser. Clear visual contrast between the two sides.

ELEMENT 1 - WINNER SIDE (Left):
At the top left, the word "CONSULTING" in handwritten capitals (40px). Below it, a large hand-drawn "80%" in bold numerals (approximately 150px tall). The numbers should be drawn with confident, thick strokes. Below the percentage, small success indicators: an upward arrow, a star, a checkmark. A simple hand-drawn trophy or medal icon sketch (just outline, 60px tall) positioned nearby. The overall feeling of this side is successful, strong, dominant.

ELEMENT 2 - THE MULTIPLIER (Center):
In the center of the frame, a large hand-drawn "8x" (approximately 200px tall). The "8" should be bold and prominent, the "x" slightly smaller. This is circled with the orange-red accent color (#E07A5F) - a rough, hand-drawn oval or circle around the entire "8x" to emphasize this is the key insight. Above or below the 8x, a double-headed arrow pointing left and right, indicating this is the gap between the two sides.

ELEMENT 3 - LOSER SIDE (Right):
At the top right, the word "HEALTHCARE" in handwritten capitals (40px). Below it, a small hand-drawn "10%" in numerals (approximately 80px tall - noticeably smaller than the 80% on the left to visually represent the difference). Below the percentage, small failure indicators: a downward arrow, an X mark, a sad face (simple circle with two dots and a frown). A simple hand-drawn broken trophy or bandaid icon (60px). The overall feeling of this side is struggling, weak, concerning.

ELEMENT 4 - VISUAL SCALE COMPARISON:
Between the two sides, a simple hand-drawn scale or seesaw. The left side (Consulting) is weighed down heavily, the right side (Healthcare) is up in the air, showing the imbalance. This visual metaphor reinforces the gap without words. The seesaw is drawn with simple lines - a triangle fulcrum with a beam across it.

ELEMENT 5 - ANNOTATION:
At the bottom of the frame, small handwritten text: "Same AI. Same questions. 8x different results." in standard charcoal (#1e1e1e), approximately 25px. This grounds the comparison in the research methodology.

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
The orange-red (#E07A5F) is used only for the circle around "8x" in the center. This draws the eye immediately to the key insight - the magnitude of the gap.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Winner (80%) → Gap (8x) → Loser (10%)
- Story: The gap between industries is enormous
- Emotion: Surprise at the magnitude, concern if you're in a losing category

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Should feel like a David vs Goliath comparison
- Like realizing the competition isn't even close
- A "that can't be right" moment

## SLIDE-05: Top 3 Rungs

**Timestamp:** Section 2 (2:30-3:30)
**Type:** Ladder
**Supports:** "AI only sees the top 3 rungs - if you're not there, you don't exist"

### Prompt:

Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style diagram showing a ladder where AI can only see the top rungs. The style mimics Excalidraw - imperfect hand-drawn lines, wobbly shapes, handwritten text, casual sketch aesthetic like someone quickly drew this on a whiteboard to illustrate the visibility threshold concept.

BACKGROUND:
Clean white or very light cream background (#FFFFFF). NO gradients, NO textures, NO grid lines. Empty whiteboard feel.

OVERALL STYLE - EXCALIDRAW AESTHETIC:
- Lines slightly wobbly, not perfectly straight
- Shapes imperfect - rectangles aren't quite rectangular
- Corners don't quite meet perfectly
- "Sketched quickly" quality
- Stroke weight consistent (2-3px equivalent)
- Lines have slight hand-tremor quality
- Text looks handwritten, slightly uneven baseline
- Feeling: casual, authentic, human, NOT polished

LINE QUALITY:
All strokes hand-drawn:
- Slight waviness
- Varying pressure
- Endpoints don't quite connect
- "Drawn with a marker" feel
- Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e)
- Stroke weight: Medium

COMPOSITION:
Vertical ladder taking up the center-left portion of the frame (about 40% width). The ladder has 7 rungs. A horizontal "visibility line" cuts across at the 4th rung from the top. Right side has annotation and explanation. Eye moves from bottom of ladder upward to the visible zone.

ELEMENT 1 - THE LADDER STRUCTURE:
A tall vertical ladder drawn with two wobbly parallel vertical lines (the rails) and 7 horizontal lines (the rungs) connecting them. The ladder should be approximately 700px tall and 200px wide. Rails drawn with slight wobble, rungs slightly uneven in spacing (hand-drawn feel). The ladder is positioned in the left-center of the frame.

ELEMENT 2 - RUNG LABELS:
Each rung has a small label or number. From bottom to top: "#7", "#6", "#5", "#4", "#3", "#2", "#1". The labels are written in small handwritten text (20px) to the left of each rung. Alternatively, represent positions with small stick figures or dots on each rung, with more crowded lower rungs.

ELEMENT 3 - THE VISIBILITY LINE:
A horizontal dashed line extending across the frame at the level between rung #3 and #4. This line should be drawn in the orange-red accent color (#E07A5F) with hand-drawn dashes. To the right of this line, handwritten text: "AI VISIBILITY LINE" or "AI CAN SEE" with an arrow pointing upward. Below the line, "INVISIBLE" or "AI CAN'T SEE" with an arrow pointing downward.

ELEMENT 4 - VISIBLE ZONE (Top 3 Rungs):
The top 3 rungs (#1, #2, #3) should be drawn with solid, bold lines. Small radiating lines around these rungs suggest visibility/importance. A simple eye icon looking at this zone. Labels next to each: "#1 - Always mentioned", "#2 - Usually mentioned", "#3 - Sometimes mentioned" in small handwritten text (20px).

ELEMENT 5 - INVISIBLE ZONE (Bottom 4 Rungs):
Rungs #4, #5, #6, #7 are drawn with dashed or dotted lines to indicate they're invisible/ghosted. These rungs are drawn in a lighter gray (#999999) rather than full charcoal. Small X marks next to each to indicate they don't get mentioned. A crossed-out eye icon in this zone.

ELEMENT 6 - STICK FIGURE:
A simple stick figure climbing the ladder, positioned around rung #5 or #6, reaching upward toward the visibility line. This humanizes the concept - "you need to climb to be seen." The figure is drawn with simple lines (circle head, line body, line limbs).

ELEMENT 7 - ANNOTATION:
At the bottom right, handwritten text: "Top 3 or Nothing" or "Below the line = invisible" in small text (25px). This drives home the binary nature of AI visibility.

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
The orange-red (#E07A5F) is used only for the visibility line and possibly the label "AI VISIBILITY LINE". This creates a clear visual threshold.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Bottom of ladder → climbing up → visibility line → top 3
- Story: There's a clear cutoff - you're either visible or you don't exist
- Emotion: Urgency to climb, fear of being below the line

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Should feel like a challenge to overcome
- Like seeing where you need to get to
- Clear threshold creates urgency

COMPOSITION:
Three boxes arranged horizontally from left to right, connected by arrows. Each box represents one component of the trifecta. The boxes take up the center band of the frame. Title at top, result/conclusion at right end.

ELEMENT 1 - FRAMEWORK TITLE (Top):
At the top center of the frame, hand-drawn text "THE VISIBILITY TRIFECTA" in handwritten capitals (approximately 50px tall). A rough underline beneath it. Optionally, "3 things winners have" in smaller text below (25px).

ELEMENT 2 - BOX 1: CATEGORY LEADERSHIP (Left):
A hand-drawn rectangle (approximately 250px wide, 300px tall) positioned on the left third of the frame. Inside the box, at the top: "1" circled in a hand-drawn circle. Below that, "CATEGORY" in handwritten capitals (30px). Below that, "LEADERSHIP" in handwritten capitals (30px). At the bottom of the box, a simple icon: a trophy or crown sketch, or a "#1" ribbon. The box outline is drawn with slightly wobbly lines.

ELEMENT 3 - ARROW 1 (Left to Center):
A hand-drawn arrow pointing from Box 1 to Box 2. The arrow should be drawn with a slight curve or wobble, not perfectly straight. Arrow approximately 80px long. A small "+" sign above the arrow to indicate these components combine.

ELEMENT 4 - BOX 2: CLEAR POSITIONING (Center):
A hand-drawn rectangle (same dimensions as Box 1) positioned in the center. Inside: "2" circled, then "CLEAR" and "POSITIONING" in handwritten capitals (30px each). At the bottom, a simple icon: a target/bullseye or a unique snowflake shape representing differentiation. Box outline slightly wobbly.

ELEMENT 5 - ARROW 2 (Center to Right):
Another hand-drawn arrow pointing from Box 2 to Box 3. Same style as Arrow 1 with a "+" sign above it.

ELEMENT 6 - BOX 3: THIRD-PARTY VALIDATION (Right):
A hand-drawn rectangle positioned on the right third. Inside: "3" circled, then "THIRD-PARTY" and "VALIDATION" in handwritten capitals (30px each). At the bottom, a simple icon: a checkmark badge, award ribbon, or multiple small star ratings. Box outline slightly wobbly.

ELEMENT 7 - RESULT INDICATOR (Far Right):
After Box 3, a final arrow (larger, perhaps with double lines) pointing to the word "VISIBLE" in larger handwritten text (60px) with a checkmark next to it. This could be circled with the orange-red accent color (#E07A5F) to emphasize the goal. Optionally, small radiating lines around "VISIBLE" to suggest success/achievement.

ELEMENT 8 - EQUATION FORMAT (Bottom):
Below the three boxes, a simple equation written out: "Leadership + Positioning + Validation = VISIBILITY" in handwritten text (25px). This reinforces the formula concept.

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
The orange-red (#E07A5F) is used only for the circle around "VISIBLE" at the end, emphasizing the goal state that results from having all three components.

- "Sketched quickly" quality
- Stroke weight consistent (2-3px equivalent)
- Lines have slight hand-tremor quality
- Text looks handwritten, slightly uneven baseline
- Feeling: casual, authentic, human, NOT polished

LINE QUALITY:
All strokes hand-drawn:
- Slight waviness
- Varying pressure
- Endpoints don't quite connect
- "Drawn with a marker" feel
- Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e)
- Stroke weight: Medium

COMPOSITION:
Three-row list layout with each example taking one row. Title at top, examples stacked vertically in the center. Each row shows brand name, their positioning, and why it works. Generous spacing between rows.

ELEMENT 1 - LIST TITLE (Top):
At the top of the frame, hand-drawn text "CLEAR POSITIONING WINS" in handwritten capitals (approximately 50px tall). Below it, smaller subtitle "What AI can easily understand" in handwritten text (25px). A rough underline beneath.

ELEMENT 2 - EXAMPLE 1: HUBSPOT (First Row):
Hand-drawn number "1." on the left (40px). Next to it, "HUBSPOT" in bold handwritten capitals (40px). After a small arrow or equals sign, their positioning phrase in quotation marks: "Inbound Marketing CRM" or "THE inbound marketing platform" in handwritten text (30px). To the right, a small checkmark icon. Below this line, in smaller gray text (#999999), the reason: "Owns the category" (20px).

- Endpoints don't quite connect
- "Drawn with a marker" feel
- Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e)
- Stroke weight: Medium

COMPOSITION:
Central hub in the middle of the frame with 6 spokes radiating outward to satellite circles. The hub represents "Your Brand" or "Validation" and the satellites represent different validation sources. Diagram is centered and takes up most of the frame.

ELEMENT 1 - CENTRAL HUB:
A hand-drawn circle (approximately 200px diameter) positioned in the center of the frame. Inside the circle, "YOUR BRAND" in handwritten capitals (30px), or alternatively a simple building/company icon with "BRAND" below it. The circle outline should be obviously hand-drawn (wobbly, not perfect).

ELEMENT 2 - SPOKE LINES:
Six hand-drawn lines radiating outward from the central hub, evenly-ish spaced around the circle (like a clock: 12, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 positions). Each line is approximately 150px long, slightly wobbly, with an arrowhead pointing from the satellite toward the hub (indicating validation flows TO the brand).

ELEMENT 3 - SATELLITE 1: G2 (Top):
A smaller hand-drawn circle (approximately 120px diameter) at the end of the top spoke. Inside: "G2" in handwritten text (30px) and a small star rating icon (5 simple stars in a row).

ELEMENT 4 - SATELLITE 2: CLUTCH (Upper Right):
Same size circle at upper right position. Inside: "CLUTCH" in handwritten text (25px) and a small badge/award icon.

ELEMENT 5 - SATELLITE 3: GARTNER (Lower Right):
Same size circle at lower right position. Inside: "GARTNER" in handwritten text (25px) and a simple chart/quadrant icon.

Same size circle at bottom position. Inside: "AWARDS" in handwritten text (25px) and a simple trophy icon.

ELEMENT 7 - SATELLITE 5: PRESS (Lower Left):
Same size circle at lower left position. Inside: "PRESS" in handwritten text (25px) and a simple newspaper/article icon.

ELEMENT 8 - SATELLITE 6: REVIEWS (Upper Left):
Same size circle at upper left position. Inside: "REVIEWS" in handwritten text (25px) and a simple speech bubble with stars icon.

ELEMENT 9 - TITLE AND ANNOTATION:
At the top of the frame, above the diagram: "THIRD-PARTY VALIDATION" in handwritten capitals (40px). At the bottom, small annotation: "AI trusts what others say about you" (25px).

ELEMENT 10 - HIGHLIGHT:
One of the satellites (perhaps G2 or Gartner) has its circle drawn with the orange-red accent color (#E07A5F) outline to emphasize it as particularly important, or the phrase "AI trusts" is underlined in orange.

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
The orange-red (#E07A5F) is used sparingly - either one satellite circle outline or an underline on key text. This highlights the importance of external validation without overusing the accent.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Title → Central hub → Radiating out to sources → Back to center
- Story: Your visibility depends on what external sources say about you
- Emotion: Understanding of ecosystem, actionable knowledge of where to focus

MOOD AND FEELING:

- Lines have slight hand-tremor quality
- Text looks handwritten, slightly uneven baseline
- Feeling: casual, authentic, human, NOT polished

LINE QUALITY:
All strokes hand-drawn:
- Slight waviness
- Varying pressure
- Endpoints don't quite connect
- "Drawn with a marker" feel
- Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e)
- Stroke weight: Medium

COMPOSITION:
Classic iceberg layout with horizontal water line across the middle of the frame. Small visible portion above water (B2C), large hidden portion below water (B2B). Labels and annotations on both sides. Iceberg is center-positioned.

ELEMENT 1 - THE WATER LINE:
A horizontal wavy line across the middle of the frame, drawn with hand-drawn waviness to represent water surface. The line extends from left edge to right edge. This line is drawn in the orange-red accent color (#E07A5F) to emphasize the visibility threshold. Small wave patterns along the line.

ELEMENT 2 - ABOVE WATER (B2C - Small Tip):
The visible tip of the iceberg above the water line - a small triangular shape taking up approximately 15-20% of the total iceberg mass. This portion is drawn with solid lines. Inside or next to this section: "B2C" in handwritten text (30px). Small radiating lines around it to indicate visibility. Label: "AI SEES THIS" with an eye icon. Examples in small text: "Nike, Apple, Amazon" (20px).

ELEMENT 3 - BELOW WATER (B2B - Large Mass):
The massive underwater portion of the iceberg - drawn with dashed or dotted lines to indicate it's hidden/invisible. This takes up approximately 80-85% of the total iceberg mass. The shape expands below the waterline into a large irregular mass. Inside this section: "B2B" in large handwritten text (50px). Label: "AI DOESN'T SEE THIS" with a crossed-out eye icon. Examples in small text: "Consulting, Agencies, Services" (20px).

ELEMENT 4 - SIZE CONTRAST LABELS:
On the left side of the iceberg: "10%" pointing to the above-water portion, "90%" pointing to the below-water portion. These emphasize the dramatic size difference. The percentages are in handwritten text (30px).

ELEMENT 5 - THE BLINDSPOT CALLOUT:
On the right side of the frame, a callout box or speech bubble with: "THE B2B BLINDSPOT" in handwritten capitals (35px). Below it: "Word of mouth worked... until AI took over research" in smaller handwritten text (20px).

ELEMENT 6 - VISUAL CONTRAST:
Above the water: bright, solid lines, success indicators (checkmarks, stars). Below the water: dashed lines, drawn in lighter gray (#999999), failure indicators (X marks, question marks).

ELEMENT 7 - ANNOTATION:
At the bottom of the frame: "B2B decisions now start with AI. Are you visible?" in handwritten text (25px).

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
The orange-red (#E07A5F) is used for the water line, emphasizing the visibility threshold. This is the most important element - the line between seen and unseen.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Tip above water → Water line (threshold) → Massive hidden mass below
- Story: Most B2B companies are invisible because they relied on old methods
- Emotion: Alarm if you're B2B, realization of the problem

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Should feel like a wake-up call for B2B companies

All strokes hand-drawn:
- Slight waviness
- Varying pressure
- Endpoints don't quite connect
- "Drawn with a marker" feel
- Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e)
- Stroke weight: Medium

COMPOSITION:
Classic left vs right comparison. Left side (45%) shows the winner (Warby Parker). Center (10%) has the "vs" divider. Right side (45%) shows the loser (Casper). Clear visual contrast between sides. Title at top establishes the pattern.

ELEMENT 1 - COMPARISON TITLE (Top):
At the top of the frame: "THE 'ME TOO' PROBLEM" in handwritten capitals (50px). Below it, smaller text: "Category definers win. Copycats lose." (25px). This frames the comparison.

ELEMENT 2 - WINNER SIDE: WARBY PARKER (Left):
A hand-drawn box or section on the left side. At the top: "WARBY PARKER" in bold handwritten capitals (40px). Below the name: "= DTC Eyewear" in handwritten text (30px), indicating they defined the category. A simple glasses icon sketch (60px wide). Below that: "DEFINED THE CATEGORY" in smaller text (25px).

Below Casper, a small list showing the competition: "Purple, Nectar, Tuft & Needle, Leesa..." in very small handwritten text (15px). This visualizes why Casper is lost in the crowd. A rough bracket grouping all these names together with "= commoditized" next to it.

ELEMENT 6 - VISUAL CONTRAST:
Left side has solid lines, bright indicators, confident strokes. Right side has some dashed lines, ghosted elements, uncertain indicators. This visual contrast reinforces the message without words.

ELEMENT 7 - KEY INSIGHT (Bottom):
At the bottom of the frame: "AI recommends category leaders, not 'also-rans'" in handwritten text (25px). This drives home the takeaway.

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
The orange-red (#E07A5F) is used for "ONE OF MANY" on the right side (either circled or underlined) and possibly the X mark next to "INVISIBLE". This highlights the problem state.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Title (pattern) → Winner (Warby) → vs → Loser (Casper) → Competitors → Takeaway
- Story: Defining a category = visible. Being one of many = invisible.
- Emotion: Understanding of differentiation importance, fear of being commoditized

**Type:** Big Stat
**Supports:** "Healthcare disaster: 10 brands tested, only 1 mentioned"

### Prompt:

Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style diagram showing the shocking healthcare statistic - 10 brands tested, only 1 mentioned by AI. The style mimics Excalidraw - imperfect hand-drawn lines, wobbly shapes, handwritten text, casual sketch aesthetic like someone quickly drew this on a whiteboard to highlight a disaster.

BACKGROUND:
Clean white or very light cream background (#FFFFFF). NO gradients, NO textures, NO grid lines. Empty whiteboard feel.

OVERALL STYLE - EXCALIDRAW AESTHETIC:
- Lines slightly wobbly, not perfectly straight
- Shapes imperfect - rectangles aren't quite rectangular
- Corners don't quite meet perfectly
- "Sketched quickly" quality
- Stroke weight consistent (2-3px equivalent)
- Lines have slight hand-tremor quality
- Text looks handwritten, slightly uneven baseline
- Feeling: casual, authentic, human, NOT polished

LINE QUALITY:
All strokes hand-drawn:
- Slight waviness
- Varying pressure
- Endpoints don't quite connect
- "Drawn with a marker" feel
- Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e)
- Stroke weight: Medium

COMPOSITION:
Centered layout with the shocking statistic as the dominant element. A row of icons at top represents the 10 brands. The fraction "1/10" is massive in the center. Supporting context below explains what this means.

ELEMENT 1 - CATEGORY LABEL (Top):
At the top of the frame: "HEALTHCARE" in handwritten capitals (50px) with a simple medical cross icon (30px) next to it. Below it, smaller text: "The worst performing category" (25px). This establishes context.

ELEMENT 2 - ROW OF 10 (Visual Representation):
A horizontal row of 10 simple icons representing the brands tested. These could be: simple building outlines, medical bag icons, or pill/health symbols. Each approximately 50px wide, spaced evenly. 9 of them are drawn with dashed/dotted lines and X marks through them (representing invisible brands). 1 of them (the first or last) is drawn with solid lines and a checkmark (representing the one visible brand). This visual immediately shows the 1-in-10 ratio.

ELEMENT 3 - THE DOMINANT FRACTION (Center):
Massive hand-drawn fraction "1/10" positioned in the center of the frame. The "1" is approximately 250px tall. The fraction line is a bold hand-drawn horizontal stroke. The "10" is approximately 200px tall. The entire fraction is circled with the orange-red accent color (#E07A5F) - a rough, hand-drawn oval emphasizing the shocking ratio.

ELEMENT 4 - TRANSLATION TEXT (Below Fraction):
Below the fraction: "mentioned" in handwritten text (40px). This completes the sentence: "1/10 mentioned." Below that, smaller text: "9 healthcare brands were completely invisible to AI" (25px).

ELEMENT 5 - VISUAL DISASTER INDICATORS:
Around the statistic, hand-drawn indicators of disaster/failure: downward arrows, X marks, a simple "skull and crossbones" or warning triangle, a sad face icon. These are scattered around the edges in the secondary gray (#999999), not competing with the main stat.

ELEMENT 6 - CONTEXT ANNOTATION (Bottom):
At the bottom of the frame: "Patients are asking AI for healthcare recommendations" in handwritten text (25px). This drives home why this matters - real decisions, real consequences.

ELEMENT 7 - COMPARISON REMINDER:
A small annotation: "vs. Consulting at 80%" in smaller gray text (20px) positioned to the side. This reminds viewers of the gap from earlier in the video.

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
The orange-red (#E07A5F) is used for the circle around "1/10" and possibly the X marks through the invisible brand icons. This creates visual alarm appropriate to a "disaster" statistic.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Category label → Row of 10 (visual ratio) → Fraction (shock) → Context (why it matters)
- Story: Healthcare is a disaster for AI visibility - patients are being steered blind
- Emotion: Alarm, concern, urgency for healthcare brands

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Should feel like a crisis alert
- Like seeing a patient outcome statistic
- Urgent and concerning

The circle is drawn with intentionally wobbly lines (Excalidraw style). Above or inside the non-overlapping portion: "ChatGPT" in handwritten text (35px). Inside the unique left area: text listing "Brand A, Brand B, Brand C" in small handwritten text (20px), or simple icons representing unique brands recommended only by ChatGPT.

ELEMENT 3 - RIGHT CIRCLE: GEMINI:
A hand-drawn circle (same size) positioned on the right-center, overlapping with the left circle. Same wobbly drawing style. Above or inside the non-overlapping portion: "Gemini" in handwritten text (35px). Inside the unique right area: text listing "Brand X, Brand Y, Brand Z" in small handwritten text (20px), or simple icons representing unique brands recommended only by Gemini.

ELEMENT 4 - OVERLAP SECTION:
The middle overlapping area (vesica piscis shape) represents brands mentioned by both. This area is highlighted with the orange-red accent color (#E07A5F) - either the overlap boundary is drawn in orange, or there's a label pointing to it in orange. Inside the overlap: "BOTH" in handwritten text (30px), and below it: a much smaller list or even just "Few brands" or "Only 2-3" indicating how small the agreement is.

ELEMENT 5 - VISUAL CONTRAST:
The unique areas (left-only and right-only) are larger than the overlap, visually showing that disagreement is the norm. Small X marks or question marks in these areas indicate the confusion/disagreement.

ELEMENT 6 - ANNOTATION ARROWS:
Hand-drawn arrows pointing to different sections with labels:
- Arrow to left unique area: "Only ChatGPT mentions" (20px)
- Arrow to right unique area: "Only Gemini mentions" (20px)
- Arrow to overlap: "Both mention" (20px) with checkmark

ELEMENT 7 - KEY INSIGHT (Bottom):
At the bottom of the frame: "You need to optimize for BOTH, not just one" in handwritten text (25px). This drives home the strategic implication. The word "BOTH" could be underlined or circled.

ELEMENT 8 - PERCENTAGE ANNOTATIONS:
Inside each section, small percentages or counts:
- Left unique: "40%" or "4 brands"
- Right unique: "40%" or "4 brands"
- Overlap: "20%" or "2 brands"
These numbers emphasize the small overlap.

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
The orange-red (#E07A5F) is used for the overlap section outline or label, and possibly the word "BOTH" in the bottom annotation. This highlights the key insight - the overlap (agreement) is surprisingly small.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Title → ChatGPT circle → Overlap (small) → Gemini circle → Takeaway
- Story: AI platforms disagree more than they agree - you can't optimize for just one
- Emotion: Realization of complexity, understanding of multi-platform challenge

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Should feel like a surprising discovery
- Like realizing the problem is bigger than you thought
- Strategic insight that changes approach

## SLIDE-13: Winners vs Losers

**Timestamp:** Payoff (10:30-11:30)
**Type:** Checklist
**Supports:** "Winners have 3 things (checks), losers are missing them (X's)"

### Prompt:

Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style checklist diagram showing what winners have (3 checkmarks) versus what losers are missing (3 X marks). The style mimics Excalidraw - imperfect hand-drawn lines, wobbly shapes, handwritten text, casual sketch aesthetic like someone quickly drew this on a whiteboard to summarize the key patterns.

BACKGROUND:
Clean white or very light cream background (#FFFFFF). NO gradients, NO textures, NO grid lines. Empty whiteboard feel.

OVERALL STYLE - EXCALIDRAW AESTHETIC:
- Lines slightly wobbly, not perfectly straight
- Shapes imperfect - rectangles aren't quite rectangular
- Corners don't quite meet perfectly
- "Sketched quickly" quality
- Stroke weight consistent (2-3px equivalent)
- Lines have slight hand-tremor quality
- Text looks handwritten, slightly uneven baseline
- Feeling: casual, authentic, human, NOT polished

LINE QUALITY:
All strokes hand-drawn:
- Slight waviness
- Varying pressure
- Endpoints don't quite connect
- "Drawn with a marker" feel
- Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e)
- Stroke weight: Medium

COMPOSITION:
Two-column layout. Left column (45%) shows winners with checkmarks. Right column (45%) shows losers with X marks. Clear visual contrast between sides. Title at top establishes the comparison.

ELEMENT 1 - COMPARISON TITLE (Top):
At the top of the frame: "WINNERS vs LOSERS" in handwritten capitals (50px). Below it: "What the visible brands have in common" (25px). A horizontal line or divider below the title.

ELEMENT 2 - WINNERS COLUMN (Left):
Column header: "WINNERS" in bold handwritten capitals (40px) with a simple trophy icon next to it. Below, three checklist items, each with a hand-drawn checkbox (square) with a checkmark inside:
- [ ] "Category Leadership" - checkbox checked, text in handwritten style (30px)
- [ ] "Clear Positioning" - checkbox checked
- [ ] "Third-Party Validation" - checkbox checked
The checkmarks are drawn boldly in the standard charcoal color. Each item has adequate spacing (80px between items). A vertical bracket on the left groups all three items, with "= VISIBLE" at the bottom of the bracket.

ELEMENT 3 - DIVIDER (Center):
A vertical hand-drawn line separating the two columns. Slightly wavy/wobbly.

ELEMENT 4 - LOSERS COLUMN (Right):
Column header: "LOSERS" in handwritten capitals (40px) with a simple X mark or sad face icon next to it. Below, three checklist items, each with a hand-drawn checkbox (square) with an X mark inside (or empty checkbox with X drawn through the whole item):
- [X] "Category Leadership" - crossed out, drawn in lighter gray (#999999) or with strikethrough
- [X] "Clear Positioning" - crossed out
- [X] "Third-Party Validation" - crossed out
The X marks are drawn in the orange-red accent color (#E07A5F) to emphasize what's missing. A vertical bracket groups all three items, with "= INVISIBLE" at the bottom.

ELEMENT 5 - VISUAL CONTRAST:
Winners side has solid, confident strokes, perhaps small stars or success indicators scattered around. Losers side has dashed lines, lighter stroke weight, perhaps question marks or concern indicators.

ELEMENT 6 - KEY INSIGHT CALLOUT:
At the bottom center of the frame, a hand-drawn box or callout: "All 3 required. Missing any = invisible." in handwritten text (25px). This emphasizes that it's not a "pick 2 of 3" situation.

ELEMENT 7 - SCORE INDICATOR:
Below each column, a simple score: "3/3" under Winners (with checkmark), "0/3" under Losers (with X mark). This reinforces the binary nature.

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
The orange-red (#E07A5F) is used for the X marks in the Losers column and possibly "INVISIBLE" text. This highlights what's wrong/missing - the critical failures.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Title → Winners (success pattern) → Losers (failure pattern) → Insight (all 3 required)
- Story: There's a clear pattern - winners have all three, losers have none
- Emotion: Clarity on what to fix, actionable checklist

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Should feel like a summary/conclusion
- Like getting the answer key after a test
- Clear, actionable, memorable

THIS SHOULD NOT FEEL LIKE:
- Corporate PowerPoint
- Polished infographic
- Technical diagram
- Stock illustration

## SLIDE-14: Shouting into Headphones

**Timestamp:** Payoff/Closer (11:30-12:00)
**Type:** Stick Figure
**Supports:** "Shouting into a room where everyone is wearing noise-canceling headphones"

### Prompt:

Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style stick figure illustration showing a person shouting while surrounded by people wearing headphones who can't hear them. The style mimics Excalidraw - imperfect hand-drawn lines, wobbly shapes, handwritten text, casual sketch aesthetic like someone quickly drew this on a whiteboard to illustrate the futility of being invisible.

BACKGROUND:
Clean white or very light cream background (#FFFFFF). NO gradients, NO textures, NO grid lines. Empty whiteboard feel.

OVERALL STYLE - EXCALIDRAW AESTHETIC:
- Lines slightly wobbly, not perfectly straight
- Shapes imperfect - circles for heads aren't quite circular
- Corners don't quite meet perfectly
- "Sketched quickly" quality
- Stroke weight consistent (2-3px equivalent)
- Lines have slight hand-tremor quality
- Text looks handwritten, slightly uneven baseline
- Feeling: casual, authentic, human, NOT polished

LINE QUALITY:
All strokes hand-drawn:
- Slight waviness
- Varying pressure
- Endpoints don't quite connect
- "Drawn with a marker" feel
- Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e)
- Stroke weight: Medium

COMPOSITION:
Central stick figure (the brand) is shouting/gesturing, surrounded by 5-6 other stick figures who are all wearing headphones and oblivious. The central figure is emphasized, the surrounding figures form a loose semicircle or crowd. Speech/sound elements emanate from the central figure but don't reach the others.

ELEMENT 1 - CENTRAL FIGURE (The Brand):
A stick figure positioned in the center-left of the frame, drawn slightly larger than the others (approximately 200px tall). The figure is in an active pose - arms raised, mouth open (indicated by a small open circle or speech lines), leaning forward. This figure represents the invisible brand trying to be heard. A label "YOUR BRAND" or "YOU" in small handwritten text (20px) above or next to this figure.

ELEMENT 2 - SOUND WAVES/SPEECH:
From the central figure's mouth, hand-drawn curved lines radiating outward representing sound/speech. These lines could be traditional sound wave curves or speech bubble shapes. The sound waves should be prominent - 3-4 curved lines getting larger as they radiate out. Drawn in standard charcoal (#1e1e1e). Add a speech bubble with "HEY!" or "HELLO?" in handwritten text (25px) to emphasize the attempt to communicate.

ELEMENT 3 - SURROUNDING FIGURES (The Audience):
5-6 stick figures arranged in a loose semicircle around the central figure, each approximately 150px tall. Each figure has:
- Simple circle head
- Line body and limbs
- Headphone shapes on their heads (simple arcs over the head connecting ear areas)
- Neutral or turned-away poses (facing away from center, looking at phones, arms crossed)
These figures are drawn in a slightly lighter gray (#999999) to emphasize they're not engaged.

ELEMENT 4 - HEADPHONES DETAIL:
The headphones on each surrounding figure should be clearly visible - drawn as curved lines over the head with small circles/ovals on the ears. These are the key visual element that explains why no one is listening. A small label "HEADPHONES" with an arrow pointing to one figure's headphones, or "NOISE-CANCELING" in small text (15px).

ELEMENT 5 - BLOCKED SOUND VISUAL:
The sound waves from the central figure should be shown hitting the surrounding figures but being blocked. This can be indicated by:
- X marks where sound waves meet headphones
- Dashed lines that fade before reaching the figures
- Sound waves bouncing off/deflecting away from the headphone-wearing figures
This visual shows the sound is not getting through.

ELEMENT 6 - METAPHOR LABEL:
At the top of the frame, title text: "BEING INVISIBLE TO AI" in handwritten capitals (40px). Below it, the metaphor spelled out: "= Shouting in a room of headphones" in handwritten text (25px).

ELEMENT 7 - EMOTIONAL INDICATORS:
The central figure could have frustration indicators: sweat drops, exclamation marks, red face (indicated by heat lines). The surrounding figures could have musical notes near their heads (listening to something else) or phone screens they're looking at (distracted by AI recommendations from other brands).

ELEMENT 8 - KEY INSIGHT (Bottom):
At the bottom of the frame: "Your message doesn't matter if AI isn't delivering it" in handwritten text (25px). The word "AI" could be circled or underlined with the orange-red accent color (#E07A5F).

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
The orange-red (#E07A5F) is used sparingly - perhaps for the X marks where sound is blocked, or underlining "AI" in the bottom insight, or small emphasis on the central figure's frustration. This highlights the problem without overwhelming.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Central figure (you) → Sound waves (your message) → Blocked by headphones → Surrounding figures (oblivious audience)
- Story: No matter how loud you shout, if AI isn't amplifying you, no one hears
- Emotion: Frustration, futility, urgency to fix the problem

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Should feel like a relatable frustration
- Like experiencing being ignored despite effort
- The "aha" moment that crystalizes the problem

THIS SHOULD NOT FEEL LIKE:
- Corporate PowerPoint
- Polished infographic
- Technical diagram
- Stock illustration

COLOR PALETTE SUMMARY:
- Background: #FFFFFF
- Primary strokes: #1e1e1e (central figure, sound waves)
- Secondary/ghosted: #999999 (surrounding figures)
- Accent: #E07A5F (blocked indicators, key text)
