## Stakes-Based Structure (NOT Logical Order)

**Order content by URGENCY, not logic. Each section should make viewers MORE anxious.**

### Section 1: Answer the Query (0:00-0:30)
**Search intent answer:** "You searched AI search visibility. Here's the answer: You need three things - category leadership, clear positioning, and third-party validation. Without all three, you're invisible."

**Tension opener:** "But 53% of well-known brands have NONE of these."

**Climax tease:** "At minute 7, I'll show you a $100B company that AI completely ignores."

### Section 2: You're Exposed (0:30-2:00)
**The problem is real:** Live demo - ask ChatGPT for best payment processor, show Stripe is invisible

**Visual proof:** Screen recording + SLIDE-01 (Stripe Reveal)

### Section 3: It's Worse Than You Think (2:00-4:00)
**Escalate stakes:**
- SLIDE-02: 53% of 100 brands invisible
- SLIDE-03: Category chart - Healthcare 10%, Consulting 80%
- SLIDE-04: 8x gap between best and worst
- SLIDE-11: Healthcare disaster (1/10 mentioned)

### Section 4: Here's Why (4:00-6:00)
**The insight:** Three patterns every visible brand has:
- SLIDE-05: Ladder (Category Leadership - top 3 only)
- SLIDE-07: Positioning List (HubSpot, Notion, Wealthfront examples)
- SLIDE-08: Hub & Spoke (Third-party validation sources)

### Section 5: The Climax (6:00-8:00)
**The "holy shit" moments:**
1. SLIDE-09: B2B Blindspot (Iceberg) - massive companies invisible
2. SLIDE-10: Me Too Problem (Warby vs Casper)
3. SLIDE-12: ChatGPT vs Gemini disagree (Venn)

**Why it's surprising:** Even $100B companies and famous DTC brands are invisible. It's not about size - it's about the pattern.

### Section 6: The Fix (8:00-9:30)
**What to do:**
1. Audit visibility (10-query test)
2. Nail positioning ("best for" statement)
3. Get third-party validation (G2, Clutch, awards)

**Visual:** SLIDE-13: Winners vs Losers checklist

### Section 7: CTA (9:30-end)
**Single takeaway:** SLIDE-14: Headphones metaphor - "Shouting into a room of noise-canceling headphones"

**Next video:** FueGenix case study - "How one clinic went from invisible to 'gold standard' in 30 days"

## Mid-Video Climax (REQUIRED)

**Timestamp:** 6:00-8:00
**The reveals:**
1. B2B Blindspot - Stripe/Square invisible despite $100B+ value
2. Me Too Problem - Warby visible, Casper invisible (same size, different visibility)
3. Platform Split - ChatGPT and Gemini recommend different brands

**Climax Checklist:**
- [X] Happens at 6:00-8:00 (not in hook)
- [X] Is VISUAL (iceberg, comparison, venn diagrams)
- [X] Is SURPRISING (B2B giants invisible, platforms disagree)
- [X] RESOLVES the tension (explains the pattern behind visibility)
