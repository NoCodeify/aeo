## GIF 1: Porsche Purchase Reveal

**Timestamp:** 1:15
**Script Context:** "I bought the Porsche. [PAUSE] That's when it hit me."
**Emotional Beat:** Confession/reveal that lands with humor
**Category:** Self-Deprecation/Surprise

### Search Queries (try in order):
1. **Giphy:** "well that happened gif"
2. **Tenor:** "impulse decision gif"
3. **Alternative:** "no regrets gif"
4. **Alternative:** "treat yourself gif"
5. **Alternative:** "money flying away gif"

**Duration:** 1.5-2 seconds
**Placement:** During the [PAUSE] after "I bought the Porsche"
**Notes:** Should feel like a comedic beat. Not over-the-top celebration, more like "yep, I did that." Parks and Rec "treat yourself" or similar self-aware splurge reaction works well.

---

## GIF 2: 53% Invisible Stat

**Timestamp:** 2:00
**Script Context:** "53% of well-known brands never got mentioned. Not once."
**Emotional Beat:** Shock at the scale of the problem
**Category:** Shock/Disbelief

### Search Queries (try in order):
1. **Giphy:** "jaw drop gif"
2. **Tenor:** "shocked pikachu"
3. **Alternative:** "mind blown gif"
4. **Alternative:** "what the actual gif"
5. **Alternative:** "excuse me what gif"

**Duration:** 1-1.5 seconds
**Placement:** Immediately after "Not once."
**Notes:** Classic shock reaction. Surprised Pikachu is perfect here because it's become internet shorthand for "this obvious thing happened and we're all shocked." The stat is brutal enough to warrant a genuine shock GIF.

---

## GIF 3: Healthcare 10% Visible (MARKED IN SCRIPT)

**Timestamp:** 3:00
**Script Context:** "Healthcare and clinics? 10% visible. One out of ten brands got mentioned."
**Emotional Beat:** The most brutal stat in the video
**Category:** Shock/Horror

### Search Queries (try in order):
1. **Giphy:** "shocked face reaction gif"
2. **Tenor:** "horrified gif"
3. **Alternative:** "that's brutal gif"
4. **Alternative:** "oof size large gif"
5. **Alternative:** "visibly shaken gif"

**Duration:** 1.5-2 seconds
**Placement:** Right after "One out of ten brands got mentioned"
**Notes:** This is the video's most shocking data point. The GIF should convey genuine "oh no" energy. The script already marks [GIF: Shocked reaction] here. Consider using a more intense shock GIF than #2 since this stat is worse.

---

## GIF 4: Top 3 or Invisible

**Timestamp:** 4:30
**Script Context:** "If you're not in the top 3 of your category, AI doesn't know you exist."
**Emotional Beat:** Harsh reality check
**Category:** Brutal Truth/Pain

### Search Queries (try in order):
1. **Giphy:** "harsh truth gif"
2. **Tenor:** "brutal honesty gif"
3. **Alternative:** "that's cold gif"
4. **Alternative:** "reality check gif"
5. **Alternative:** "tough love gif"

**Duration:** 1-1.5 seconds
**Placement:** After "AI doesn't know you exist"
**Notes:** This is a "tough love" moment. The GIF should feel like someone getting hit with uncomfortable truth. Something from a comedy where someone delivers brutal honesty works well.

---

## GIF 5: Stripe $100B Invisible

**Timestamp:** 6:15
**Script Context:** "Stripe. $100 billion company. Powers half the internet. Completely invisible."
**Emotional Beat:** Cognitive dissonance - how can this be?
**Category:** Disbelief/Confusion

### Search Queries (try in order):
1. **Giphy:** "wait what gif"
2. **Tenor:** "confused math lady gif"
3. **Alternative:** "does not compute gif"
4. **Alternative:** "how is that possible gif"
5. **Alternative:** "blinking guy gif"

**Duration:** 1.5-2 seconds
**Placement:** After "Completely invisible"
**Notes:** The "confused math lady" or "blinking white guy" meme works perfectly here. The disconnect between $100B valuation and zero visibility creates genuine "wait, what?" confusion.

---

## GIF 6: Me Too = Invisible

**Timestamp:** 7:00
**Script Context:** "If you're 'another option' instead of 'THE option' - AI doesn't bother mentioning you."
**Emotional Beat:** Self-realization/uncomfortable truth
**Category:** Realization/Pain

### Search Queries (try in order):
1. **Giphy:** "oof that hurts gif"
2. **Tenor:** "ouch gif"
3. **Alternative:** "felt that gif"
4. **Alternative:** "too real gif"
5. **Alternative:** "why would you say that gif"

**Duration:** 1-1.5 seconds
**Placement:** After "AI doesn't bother mentioning you"
**Notes:** This hits close to home for many viewers. The GIF should feel like a personal attack that the viewer knows is true. "Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave" energy.

---

## GIF 7: The Healthcare Disaster

**Timestamp:** 7:50
**Script Context:** "Cleveland Clinic? One of the best hospitals in the world. Invisible. Mayo Clinic? Invisible."
**Emotional Beat:** Brutal, repeated punches
**Category:** Pain/Disbelief

### Search Queries (try in order):
1. **Giphy:** "that's rough buddy gif"
2. **Tenor:** "getting punched repeatedly gif"
3. **Alternative:** "stop stop he's already dead gif"
4. **Alternative:** "emotional damage gif"
5. **Alternative:** "oof gif"

**Duration:** 1.5-2 seconds
**Placement:** After "Mayo Clinic? Invisible."
**Notes:** The back-to-back reveals (Cleveland Clinic + Mayo Clinic) feel like repeated punches. "Stop, stop, he's already dead" from The Simpsons or "emotional damage" captures this well.

---

## GIF 8: Wrong Query Optimization

**Timestamp:** 8:20
**Script Context:** "They're still optimizing for 'healthcare near me.' That query doesn't exist in ChatGPT."
**Emotional Beat:** Oblivious brands doing the wrong thing
**Category:** Denial/This Is Fine

### Search Queries (try in order):
1. **Giphy:** "this is fine dog gif"
2. **Tenor:** "this is fine meme gif"
3. **Alternative:** "everything is fine fire gif"
4. **Alternative:** "denial gif"
5. **Alternative:** "ignoring problems gif"

**Duration:** 2-2.5 seconds
**Placement:** After "That query doesn't exist in ChatGPT"
**Notes:** This is THE "this is fine" moment. Brands optimizing for queries that don't exist while everything burns around them. The dog in the burning room is perfect. Let it play slightly longer for comedic effect.

---

## GIF 9: Noise-Canceling Metaphor (Closer)

**Timestamp:** 9:45
**Script Context:** "They'll be shouting into a room where everyone is wearing noise-canceling headphones."
**Emotional Beat:** Futility/powerful closing image
**Category:** Frustration/Futility

### Search Queries (try in order):
1. **Giphy:** "shouting into void gif"
2. **Tenor:** "nobody listening gif"
3. **Alternative:** "talking to wall gif"
4. **Alternative:** "screaming no one cares gif"
5. **Alternative:** "hello is anyone there gif"

**Duration:** 1.5-2 seconds
**Placement:** After "noise-canceling headphones"
**Notes:** This is the closing metaphor. The GIF should reinforce the futility of marketing to an audience that literally cannot hear you. Someone shouting while being ignored works well. Don't go too comedic here - this is a serious closer.

---

## Additional GIF Opportunities (Optional)

### Bonus 1: The Data Reveal

**Timestamp:** 2:30
**Script Context:** "The results were brutal."
**Emotional Beat:** Bracing for impact

### Search Queries:
1. **Giphy:** "brace yourselves gif"
2. **Tenor:** "here we go gif"
3. **Alternative:** "oh boy here we go gif"

**Notes:** Only use if the pacing feels slow before the data section. This is optional.

---

### Bonus 2: ChatGPT vs Gemini Disagree

**Timestamp:** 8:45
**Script Context:** "ChatGPT and Gemini disagree. A lot."
**Emotional Beat:** Frustrating complexity

### Search Queries:
1. **Giphy:** "confused gif"
2. **Tenor:** "make up your mind gif"
3. **Alternative:** "which one is it gif"

**Notes:** Only use if this section feels like it needs a beat. The point is made quickly so a GIF might slow it down.
