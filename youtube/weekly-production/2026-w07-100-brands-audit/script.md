## SECTION 1: ANSWER THE QUERY (0:00-0:30)

You searched "AI search visibility." Here's the answer:

To get recommended by ChatGPT and Gemini, you need three things: category leadership, clear positioning, and third-party validation. Without all three, you're invisible.

[SLIDE-06: VISIBILITY TRIFECTA]

But here's what most people miss: 53% of well-known brands have NONE of these. They're completely invisible to AI right now.

I just audited 100 brands to prove it. And at minute 7, I'll show you the exact pattern that separates winners from losers - including a $100 billion company that AI completely ignores.

---

## SECTION 2: YOU'RE EXPOSED (0:30-2:00)

Let me show you what invisible looks like.

[SCREEN RECORDING: Type "best payment processor for online store" into ChatGPT]

Watch this. I'm asking ChatGPT for the best payment processor.

[Show results - Stripe barely appears or doesn't appear]

Stripe. $100 billion valuation. Powers Amazon, Google, Shopify. Half the internet runs on Stripe.

[SLIDE-01: STRIPE REVEAL]

Zero mentions. Or buried at the bottom.

This isn't a bug. This is how AI search works. And your brand might be in the same situation right now.

I tested this across 100 brands. 10 categories. Asked ChatGPT and Gemini the same question: "What's the best [category]?"

[SLIDE-02: 53% INVISIBLE]

53% never got mentioned. Not once.

But here's what's interesting - it wasn't random. There's a clear pattern.

---

## SECTION 3: IT'S WORSE THAN YOU THINK (2:00-4:00)

Let me show you the data.

[SLIDE-03: CATEGORY CHART]

I ranked all 10 categories by visibility. Look at the gap.

Consulting firms? 80% visible. McKinsey, BCG, Bain - ChatGPT knows them all.

SaaS? 70%. HubSpot, Notion, Monday - category leaders show up.

Now look at the bottom.

Healthcare? 10% visible.

[SLIDE-11: HEALTHCARE]

One out of ten healthcare brands got mentioned. Cleveland Clinic. Mayo Clinic. Some of the best hospitals in the world. Invisible.

[SLIDE-04: 8X GAP]

The gap between best and worst is 8x. Same effort. Same brand awareness. Completely different outcomes.

And it gets worse.

These aren't small brands. These are companies spending millions on marketing. Companies with SEO teams. Companies that rank #1 on Google.

None of that matters if ChatGPT doesn't know you exist.

---

## SECTION 4: HERE'S WHY (4:00-6:00)

So what separates winners from losers?

I found three patterns. Every visible brand had all three. Every invisible brand was missing at least one.

[SLIDE-05: LADDER]

**Pattern 1: Category Leadership**

Think of it like a ladder. AI only sees the top three rungs.

When I asked "best CRM software" - HubSpot showed up. Salesforce showed up. Zoho showed up.

Pipedrive? Sometimes. Freshsales? Never.

If you're not top 3 in your category, AI doesn't know you exist.

[SLIDE-07: POSITIONING LIST]

**Pattern 2: Clear Positioning**

Every visible brand had a "best for" statement.

HubSpot: "best for SMBs who want all-in-one."
Notion: "best for docs and light project management."
Wealthfront: "best robo-advisor for passive investors."

They didn't try to be everything. They owned a specific use case.

[SLIDE-08: HUB & SPOKE]

**Pattern 3: Third-Party Validation**

This surprised me. The visible brands have reviews on G2, Clutch, Gartner. They've won awards. They're mentioned in "best of" articles.

[Show screenshot of G2 listings]

AI isn't making recommendations from scratch. It's pulling from what OTHER sources say about you.

No third-party mentions? No AI mentions.

---

## SECTION 5: THE CLIMAX (6:00-8:00)

Now here's the pattern nobody talks about.

I saved this for last because it changes everything.

[SLIDE-09: ICEBERG]

**The B2B Blindspot**

Remember Stripe? $100 billion company. Every startup uses them.

But when real people ask ChatGPT "best payment processor for my store" - Stripe barely shows up.

Why? B2B companies have relied on word of mouth. Sales teams. Integrations. They never needed consumer-facing content.

But now decisions START with AI. Your buyers are asking ChatGPT before they ever talk to sales.

[Pause]

And if you're not showing up in those queries? You're not in the consideration set.

[SLIDE-10: WARBY VS CASPER]

**The "Me Too" Problem**

Look at DTC brands.

Warby Parker? Visible. Glossier? Visible.

Casper? Invisible. Bombas? Invisible.

Same category. Same size. Completely different visibility.

The difference? Warby Parker DEFINED "DTC eyewear." Casper was one of many mattress companies.

If you're "another option" instead of "THE option" - AI doesn't bother mentioning you.

[SLIDE-12: VENN DIAGRAM]

**The Platform Split**

And here's the third reveal.

ChatGPT and Gemini disagree. A lot.

[Show side-by-side screenshots]

Same query. Different recommendations.

SoFi appeared on ChatGPT but not Gemini. Robinhood on Gemini but not ChatGPT.

Each AI has different training data. Different sources.

If you're only optimizing for one AI, you're missing half the market.

---

## SECTION 6: THE FIX (8:00-9:30)

[SLIDE-13: WINNERS VS LOSERS]

So here's exactly what to do about this.

**Step 1: Check your visibility right now.**

Go to ChatGPT. Ask "What's the best [your category]?" Do the same on Gemini. Do it 10 times - responses vary.

If you're not showing up, you have work to do.

**Step 2: Nail your positioning.**

Write a "best for" statement. One sentence. Who are you best for, and why?

Not "we help businesses grow." That's everyone.

"Best CRM for SMBs who want marketing and sales in one platform." That's HubSpot. That's what AI can extract.

**Step 3: Get third-party validation.**

G2. Clutch. Industry awards. "Best of" lists. PR mentions on sites AI trusts.

This is what AI pulls from. If you're not there, you don't exist.

I put together a free checklist that walks through all of this. Same framework I use with clients. Link's in the description. No email required.

## SECTION 7: CTA (9:30-end)

If you remember one thing from this video:

[SLIDE-14: HEADPHONES]

The brands that ignore AI visibility are shouting into a room where everyone is wearing noise-canceling headphones.

The brands that figure this out first will dominate the next decade of search.

Which one are you going to be?

Watch this video next where I show you exactly how one clinic went from invisible to Gemini calling them "the gold standard" in 30 days.

[Point to next video]

I'll see you there.
