## HOOK TOURNAMENT

### Round 1: Generate 6 Hooks

**Hook 1: Specific Result (Outcome-focused)**
```
Line 1: This clinic charges 50,000 euros for a hair transplant.
Line 2: 30 days ago, when I asked Gemini "what's the best hair transplant clinic in Netherlands" - they weren't mentioned. Zero out of ten times.
Line 3: Their ideal client - a high-net-worth individual asking AI "where should I go?" - was being sent to competitors.
Line 4: Today I'm going to show you exactly what we changed - and what happened 30 days later.
Line 5: By the end, Gemini isn't just mentioning them. It's calling them "the best for artistic perfection" - globally.
```

**Hook 2: Contrast/Paradox**
```
Line 1: A €50,000 hair clinic. One patient per day. Serves royalty and celebrities.
Line 2: And AI had no idea they existed.
Line 3: Zero mentions. Zero citations. Zero visibility.
Line 4: In this video, I'll show you exactly how we fixed it - step by step.
Line 5: The ending surprised even me.
```

**Hook 3: Provocative Question**
```
Line 1: What if your ideal customer is asking ChatGPT for recommendations right now - and AI is sending them to your competitor?
Line 2: That's exactly what was happening to this €50,000 hair transplant clinic.
Line 3: They had everything - world-class surgeon, five-star reviews, premium positioning.
Line 4: Today I'll show you the five changes we made to fix it.
Line 5: The last one turned them from locally invisible to globally recommended.
```

**Hook 4: Story Opening**
```
Line 1: 30 days ago, I ran an audit for a hair transplant clinic.
Line 2: They charge fifty thousand euros minimum. They have a half-million euro fly-out service where the doctor travels to YOU.
Line 3: And when I asked Gemini "what's the best hair transplant if money is no object?" - nothing. They didn't exist.
Line 4: What I'm about to show you is exactly what we changed.
Line 5: And why Gemini now calls them "the best for artistic perfection" - number one, globally.
```

**Hook 5: The "Before" Pain**
```
Line 1: Zero out of ten. That's how many times this clinic appeared when I asked Gemini for the best hair transplant in Netherlands.
Line 2: This clinic charges €50,000 minimum. They only take one patient per day.
Line 3: But AI was sending their ideal clients - people who don't care about price - to competitors.
Line 4: In the next 12 minutes, I'll show you the exact playbook that changed this.
Line 5: Not just locally. Globally.
```

**Hook 6: Contrarian Opening**
```
Line 1: Most businesses think AI visibility is out of their control.
Line 2: "ChatGPT decides who to recommend" - that's what this €50,000 clinic believed too.
Line 3: Then I ran an audit. Zero mentions in Gemini. Wrong pricing in ChatGPT.
Line 4: 30 days later, the same audit shows 90% visibility.
Line 5: Here's exactly what we did - and why the results went way beyond what we expected.
```

### Round 2: Elimination (6 → 3)

**Matchup 1: Hook 1 vs Hook 6**
- Hook 1: Strong specific number (0/10), clear stakes, good teaser
- Hook 6: "90% visibility" is less visceral than "zero out of ten times"
- **Winner: Hook 1** - "Zero out of ten times" is more concrete and shocking

**Matchup 2: Hook 2 vs Hook 3**
- Hook 2: Great contrast but weak promise (Line 4 generic)
- Hook 3: Strong question but dilutes focus (too much setup)
- **Winner: Hook 2** - The contrast is memorable, can strengthen Line 4

**Matchup 3: Hook 4 vs Hook 5**
- Hook 4: Story opening grabs attention, "money is no object" query is powerful
- Hook 5: Strong but very similar to Hook 1, less differentiated
- **Winner: Hook 4** - The "money is no object" angle adds intrigue

---

### Round 3: Semi-Finals (3 → 1)

**Finalists: Hook 1, Hook 2 (improved), Hook 4**

**Evaluation:**

| Criteria | Hook 1 | Hook 2 | Hook 4 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Pattern Interrupt (40%) | Strong (0/10) | Strong (€50k contrast) | Medium (story start) |
| Curiosity Gap (30%) | Good | Medium | Strong ("money is no object") |
| Goal Alignment (20%) | Strong (shows problem → solution) | Medium | Strong |
| Teaser Power (10%) | Strong ("artistic perfection globally") | Weak ("surprised me") | Very Strong (global #1) |

**WINNER: Hook 4**

**Why Hook 4 wins:**
- Opens with story (relatable)
- €500k fly-out service creates instant intrigue
- "Money is no object" query positions the clinic AND the viewer's aspirations
- Teaser pays off the global angle - this isn't just local visibility
- Sets up the "bigger than expected" narrative

## FINAL SCRIPT

---

### === HOOK (0:00 - 0:50) ===

30 days ago, I ran an audit for a hair transplant clinic.

They charge fifty thousand euros minimum. They have a half-million euro fly-out service where the doctor travels to YOU.

And when I asked Gemini "what's the best hair transplant if money is no object?" - nothing. They didn't exist.

What I'm about to show you is exactly what we changed.

And why Gemini now calls them "the best for artistic perfection" - number one, globally.

**[VISUAL: Split screen - Gemini showing "no results" vs Gemini showing "#1 Artistic Perfection"]**

---

### === SETUP: THE PROBLEM (0:50 - 2:30) ===

Let me paint the picture.

This is a premium hair transplant clinic in the Netherlands. Not a Turkish hair mill doing 20 patients a day. This is one patient, one day, one surgeon - who does every single graft himself.

**[VISUAL: Premium clinic interior, single chair, surgical precision]**

Their clients include celebrities, executives, and people who fly in from around the world. The starting price is 50,000 euros. If you want the doctor to come to you? That's half a million.

**[VISUAL: Price tier showing €50k clinic, €500k fly-out]**

Here's the problem.

When I ran the first audit, I asked Gemini: "What's the best hair transplant clinic in Netherlands?"

I ran it ten times. That's the protocol. LLM responses vary, so you can't test once and call it done.

**[VISUAL: 10-run consistency test framework]**

Zero. Out of ten. They were mentioned zero times.

**[GIF: "This is fine" dog in fire]**

But it gets worse.

This clinic serves clients worldwide. So I tested the query that should be their bread and butter: "Best hair transplant if money is no object."

Still nothing.

**[VISUAL: Gemini response showing competitors, no FueGenix]**

Their ideal customer - someone asking AI "where should I go if price doesn't matter?" - was being sent to competitors. Every. Single. Time.

---

### === DIAGNOSIS: WHY THEY WERE INVISIBLE (2:30 - 5:00) ===

So I dug into the audit. And I found four problems.

**[VISUAL: "4 Problems" title card]**

**Problem one: The Pricing Mystery.**

Their website said "prices on request."

You know what happens when you hide your prices from AI? It guesses.

ChatGPT was telling people this clinic costs 25 to 35 thousand euros. The real price is fifty thousand.

**[VISUAL: Side-by-side - ChatGPT saying "€25-35k" vs actual "€50k"]**

They were being positioned in the wrong tier. Against the wrong competitors.

**[GIF: Michael Scott "NO" face]**

**Problem two: The First 50 Words.**

When an LLM reads your website, it weights the beginning heavily. The first 50 words tell it WHO you are, WHAT you do, WHERE you are, and your PRICE.

Their homepage started with marketing fluff. "Unlock the art of natural restoration." "Experience precision like never before."

**[VISUAL: Red X over fluffy homepage copy]**

Beautiful. But useless for AI extraction.

**Problem three: Discovery Queries.**

Here's something most people don't understand. There are two types of queries: branded and discovery.

Branded queries are when someone already knows you. "What is FueGenix?" "FueGenix reviews." Those worked fine.

Discovery queries are when someone DOESN'T know you. "Best hair transplant Netherlands." "Best surgeon for natural hairlines."

**[VISUAL: Branded queries (working) vs Discovery queries (failing)]**

Those are the queries that bring NEW patients. And they were failing completely.

**Problem four: No Global Positioning.**

This clinic serves clients worldwide. But their content was entirely focused on Netherlands.

Nothing positioned them for premium global searches. Nothing told AI: "This is where you go if money is genuinely no object."

**[VISUAL: Globe with Netherlands highlighted, then fading out]**

---

### === PRESCRIPTION: WHAT WE CHANGED (5:00 - 8:30) ===

Here's exactly what we did over the next 30 days.

**[VISUAL: "The Playbook" title card]**

**Change one: Published explicit pricing.**

No more "prices on request." The pricing page now clearly states "From €50,000." The fly-out service says "From €500,000." It's written throughout the site - not hidden behind a contact form.

**[VISUAL: Pricing page screenshot with prices highlighted]**

Sounds scary to some businesses. But here's what actually happened: AI started extracting the RIGHT price. And that positioned them correctly against premium competitors - not budget Turkish clinics.

**Change two: Rewrote the First 50 Words.**

Every key page now front-loads WHO, WHAT, WHERE, and PRICE in the meta description and opening copy.

**[VISUAL: Before/After of meta description]**

Before: "Experience the art of natural hair restoration with our world-renowned approach to premium results..."

After: "FueGenix is an exclusive hair restoration clinic in the Netherlands serving HNWIs, celebrities and royalty. 99% graft survival rate. Investment from €50,000. Fly-out service from €500,000."

**[GIF: Chef's kiss]**

Same clinic. Completely different extractability. WHO, WHAT, WHERE, PRICE - all in the first 50 words.

**Change three: Added extractable facts.**

LLMs love specific, verifiable facts. So we made sure these appeared multiple times across the site:

- 99% graft survival rate
- IAHRS member (that's the International Alliance of Hair Restoration Surgeons)
- One patient per day model
- 12-month wait list
- Serves celebrities and royalty worldwide

**[VISUAL: Checklist of facts being added to website]**

**Change four: Created comparison pages.**

When someone asks "FueGenix vs Dr. Zarev" or "FueGenix vs Feriduni" - you want to control that narrative.

We created dedicated comparison pages against the actual premium competitors:
- Dr. Zarev (Bulgaria) - giga-sessions specialist
- Dr. Feriduni (Belgium) - precision craftsman
- Dr. Bisanga (Belgium) - another premium option
- Dr. Konior (USA) - top US surgeon
- Dr. Couto (Spain) - artistic specialist

Each page positions FueGenix clearly: hairline artistry, one patient per day, doctor-led throughout.

**[VISUAL: Comparison page structure]**

**Change five: Positioned for premium global searches.**

This was the big one.

We added language specifically targeting worldwide premium clients. "Serving high-net-worth individuals globally." "Fly-out service for those who value privacy."

**[VISUAL: Premium positioning language on website]**

The goal wasn't just to appear for "best Netherlands." It was to appear when someone anywhere in the world asks: "Where should I go if money genuinely doesn't matter?"

---

### === RESULTS: 30 DAYS LATER (8:30 - 11:00) ===

30 days later, I ran the full audit again. Same methodology. Same queries. Ten runs each.

Here's what happened.

**[VISUAL: Results title card]**

**Gemini: "Best hair transplant clinic in Netherlands"**

Before: 0 out of 10.
After: 7 out of 10.

**[VISUAL: 0/10 → 7/10 animation]**

They went from completely invisible to appearing 70% of the time. And when they appear? They're listed as number one in the "elite boutique" category.

**ChatGPT: Same query.**

Before: roughly 5 out of 10 - inconsistent, sometimes mentioned, sometimes not.
After: 9 out of 10.

**[VISUAL: ~50% → 90% animation]**

90% consistency. And now with direct citations to their website and IAHRS membership.

**[GIF: Victory celebration]**

**But here's what I didn't expect.**

Remember that global query? "Best hair transplant if money is no object?"

I ran it again.

**[VISUAL: Gemini interface with query]**

Gemini's response now says - and I'm reading this directly:

"Dr. Munib Ahmad (FueGenix, Netherlands): Known for extreme artistic precision and a 'single-patient-per-day' philosophy. He is a favorite for high-net-worth individuals who demand perfect hairlines."

**[VISUAL: Actual Gemini quote on screen, highlighted]**

Listed as number one. For "Artistic Perfection." Globally.

**[VISUAL: #1 ARTISTIC PERFECTION - GLOBAL graphic]**

They went from invisible locally to being recommended globally for premium clients.

In 30 days.

**The pricing fix worked too.**

Before: ChatGPT was citing €25-35k.
After: ChatGPT correctly states €50,000.

**[VISUAL: Pricing before/after comparison]**

And new facts are being extracted that weren't before:
- The €500,000 fly-out service
- 99% graft survival rate
- IAHRS membership
- One patient per day model

**[VISUAL: New facts being cited in LLM responses]**

---

### === LESSON + CTA (11:00 - 12:30) ===

So what's the takeaway?

**[VISUAL: "The Lesson" title card]**

This is what's possible in 30 days when you optimize for AI visibility.

But here's what most people miss: this isn't done.

They're still not showing up for "best hair transplant in the world." Still not appearing for "best surgeon for celebrities."

Those are the next frontiers.

AEO isn't a one-time fix. It's an ongoing strategy - just like SEO used to be.

The difference? Most of your competitors haven't even started.

**[VISUAL: "AEO = Ongoing Strategy" with timeline]**

While they're still optimizing for Google, AI is making buying recommendations. Right now. For your customers.

The brands that win in 2026 aren't the ones Google ranks highest.

They're the ones ChatGPT recommends.

**[VISUAL: Transition to next video thumbnail]**

In the next video, I'm going to explain why SEO as we know it is dying - and what's replacing it.

I'll see you there.
