# Video Brief: How I Got a Hair Clinic Mentioned in ChatGPT in 30 Days

**Date Created:** 2026-01-22
**Updated:** 2026-01-22 (with full 10-run consistency data + global queries)
**Target Publish Date:** Week 4 (2026-01-27 - 2026-02-02)
**Video Number:** Week 4 of content calendar (Video 3)

---

## Video Goal

**Primary Goal:** [x] Sales + Trust

**Success Metric:** Viewers see the system working in practice. Target: 10+ DMs asking "can you do this for my brand?" This video is PROOF that the 5-step system from Video 2 actually works.

**Key Narrative Upgrade:** This isn't just a "local visibility" story anymore. The clinic went from invisible locally to being recommended GLOBALLY for "money is no object" queries. That's the real hook.

## Video Concept

**Title Options (Tournament):**

**Outcome-focused (55% sales - best for buyers):**
1. "0% to 90% AI Visibility in 30 Days (Real Case Study)"
2. "How I Got a Clinic Recommended by ChatGPT in 30 Days"
3. "From Invisible to #1 Recommended: A 30-Day AEO Case Study"

**Story-focused (35% sales - good for both):**
4. "This Clinic Was Invisible to AI. 30 Days Later, Gemini Calls Them 'The Best'"
5. "I Made AI Recommend a €50,000 Clinic in 30 Days"
6. "The Clinic AI Ignored... Until I Did This"

**Contrarian (25% sales - growth):**
7. "Why This Clinic Appears in ChatGPT and Yours Doesn't"

**Working Title:** "0% to 90% AI Visibility in 30 Days (Real Case Study)"

**Why this title works:**
- Specific numbers (0% to 90%) create curiosity
- "Real Case Study" signals proof, not theory
- "30 Days" makes it feel achievable
- Doesn't reveal the full story (global visibility) - that's the payoff

**Thumbnail Concept:**
- Face/Emotion: Surprised/impressed, eyebrows raised, pointing at screen
- Text (3 words max): "0% → 90%"
- Visual metaphor: Split screen - left side shows "invisible" (greyed out brand), right side shows ChatGPT interface with brand highlighted as #1
- Alternative: Show the actual Gemini quote "Artistic Perfection" with arrow pointing to it

**Angle:** Show the receipts. Real numbers, real client, real timeline.

**Type:** [x] Case Study (35% sales effectiveness per Ed Lawrence data)

---

## Target Audience

**Who is this for:**
- Stage: Business owners who watched Video 2 and want proof the system works
- Problem they have: Skeptical that AEO can actually move the needle
- What they've tried: Maybe asked ChatGPT about their brand once, saw nothing

**Why they'll click:** Specific outcome (30 days, named result) + curiosity about what actually worked

**Why they'll stay:** Real data, real before/after screenshots, specific tactics they can steal

## The Story Arc

### Act 1: The Problem (0:00 - 2:30)
"30 days ago, I ran an AEO audit for a premium hair transplant clinic. This clinic charges 50,000 euros minimum. They have a 500,000 euro fly-out service where the doctor travels to YOU. They serve celebrities, royalty, executives.

And when I asked Gemini 'what's the best hair transplant clinic in Netherlands?' - they weren't mentioned. At all. Zero out of ten times.

But here's what made it worse: this clinic serves clients WORLDWIDE. So I tested the query that should be their bread and butter: 'best hair transplant if money is no object.' Still nothing."

**The stakes:** Their ideal client - a HNWI asking AI "where should I go if price doesn't matter?" - was being sent to competitors.

### Act 2: The Diagnosis (2:30 - 5:30)
"Here's what the audit revealed..."

1. **The Pricing Problem:** Website said "prices on request" - LLMs were GUESSING and getting it wrong (citing €25-35k when real price is €50k)
2. **The First 50 Words Problem:** Homepage started with marketing fluff instead of stating WHO they are, WHAT they do, WHERE they are, and PRICE
3. **The Discovery Problem:** Branded queries worked fine. But discovery queries - the ones that bring NEW patients - failed completely.
4. **The Global Problem:** No content positioning them for worldwide premium searches

### Act 3: The Prescription (5:30 - 9:00)
"Here's exactly what we changed..."

1. **Published explicit pricing:** "From €50,000" and "Fly-out from €500,000" now on the website
2. **Rewrote the First 50 Words:** WHO/WHAT/WHERE/PRICE front-loaded on every key page
3. **Added extractable facts:** 99% graft survival rate, one patient per day, IAHRS membership
4. **Created comparison pages:** vs competitors to own those queries
5. **Positioned for premium global searches:** Language about serving HNWIs, celebrities, royalty worldwide

### Act 4: The Results (9:00 - 11:30)
"30 days later, I ran the FULL 10-run consistency test. Here's what happened..."

**Gemini "Best hair transplant clinic Netherlands":**
- Before: 0/10 (0%)
- After: **7/10 (70%)**
- Often listed as **#1** in "elite/boutique" category

**ChatGPT "Best hair transplant clinic Netherlands":**
- Before: ~5/10 (50%)
- After: **9/10 (90%)**
- Now cited with direct link and IAHRS membership

**But here's the real win...**

"I tested the global query again: 'best hair transplant if money is no object.'

Gemini's response now lists them as **#1 for 'Artistic Perfection'** - in the same tier as the most famous surgeon in the world.

They went from invisible locally to being recommended GLOBALLY for premium clients."

**Pricing accuracy:**
- Before: LLMs cited wrong price (€25-35k)
- After: LLMs cite correct price (€50k)

**New facts being extracted:**
- 99% graft survival rate
- €500,000 fly-out service
- IAHRS membership
- One patient per day model
- Serves celebrities and royalty

### Act 5: The Lesson + CTA (11:30 - 13:00)
"This is what's possible in 30 days when you optimize for AI visibility.

But here's the thing - they're still not showing up for 'best hair transplant in the world' or 'best for celebrities.' Those are the next frontiers.

AEO isn't a one-time fix. It's an ongoing strategy, just like SEO used to be.

The difference? Most of your competitors haven't even started."

CTA: "In the next video, I'm going to explain why SEO as we know it is dying - and what's replacing it."
