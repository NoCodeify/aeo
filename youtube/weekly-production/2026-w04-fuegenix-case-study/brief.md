## Video Goal

**Primary Goal:** [X] Sales + Trust

**Success Metric:** Viewers see the system working in practice. Target: 10+ DMs asking "can you do this for my brand?"

**Key Narrative:** This isn't just a "local visibility" story. The clinic went from invisible locally to being recommended GLOBALLY for "money is no object" queries.

---

## Video Concept

**Title:** "This Business Was Invisible To AI. 30 Days Later, It's #1."

**Why this title works:**
- Story format (before/after transformation)
- Universal desire: Going from invisible to #1
- Time-bound result (30 days = achievable)
- Curiosity: What business? What did they do?

**OLD Title (killed):** "0% to 90% AI Visibility in 30 Days (Real Case Study)"
- Percentage feels abstract
- "Case Study" is format, not hook
- No story/transformation element

**Thumbnail Concept:**
- Text: "NOW #1"
- Face/emotion: Impressed, eyebrows raised
- Visual metaphor: Gold trophy OR #1 medal/badge
- Background: Dark navy (#0A1628) with subtle warm/gold tint
- Text color: Electric Yellow (#FFE135) with glow

**1+1=3 Check:**
- Title = journey (invisible to #1 in 30 days)
- Thumbnail = proof/result (NOW #1)
- Together = "Someone went from invisible to winning - I need to see this"

**Angle:** Show the receipts. Real numbers, real client, real timeline.

**Type:** [X] Case Study

---

## Target Audience

**Who is this for:**
- Stage: Business owners who watched the audit video and want proof the system works
- Problem they have: Skeptical that AEO can actually move the needle
- What they've tried: Maybe asked ChatGPT about their brand once, saw nothing

**Why they'll click:** Transformation story with specific outcome

**Why they'll stay:** Real data, real before/after screenshots, specific tactics they can steal

## The Story Arc

### Act 1: The Problem (0:00 - 2:30)
"30 days ago, I ran an AEO audit for a premium hair transplant clinic. This clinic charges 50,000 euros minimum. They have a 500,000 euro fly-out service where the doctor travels to YOU.

And when I asked Gemini 'what's the best hair transplant clinic in Netherlands?' - they weren't mentioned. At all. Zero out of ten times.

But here's what made it worse: I tested 'best hair transplant if money is no object.' Still nothing."

### Act 2: The Diagnosis (2:30 - 5:30)
1. **Pricing Problem:** Website said "prices on request" - LLMs were GUESSING wrong
2. **First 50 Words Problem:** Homepage started with marketing fluff
3. **Discovery Problem:** Branded queries worked. Discovery queries failed.
4. **Global Problem:** No content for worldwide premium searches

### Act 3: The Prescription (5:30 - 9:00)
1. Published explicit pricing: "From 50,000 euros"
2. Rewrote First 50 Words: WHO/WHAT/WHERE/PRICE front-loaded
3. Added extractable facts: 99% graft survival, one patient per day
4. Created comparison pages
5. Positioned for premium global searches

### Act 4: The Results (9:00 - 11:30)
**Gemini "Best hair transplant clinic Netherlands":**
- Before: 0/10 (0%)
- After: **7/10 (70%)**
- Often listed as **#1** in "elite/boutique" category

**ChatGPT "Best hair transplant clinic Netherlands":**
- Before: ~5/10 (50%)
- After: **9/10 (90%)**

**The real win:** Gemini now lists them as **#1 for 'Artistic Perfection'** for "money is no object" queries.

### Act 5: The Lesson + CTA (11:30 - 13:00)
"This is what's possible in 30 days. But AEO isn't a one-time fix. It's ongoing strategy."

## Key Numbers to Show On Screen

| Query | Engine | Before | After | Change |

## CTA Strategy

**Next video to point to:** "I Stopped Caring About Google Rankings (Here's What Happened)" (Week 5)
