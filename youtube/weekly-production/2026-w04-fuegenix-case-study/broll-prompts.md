## BROLL-01: Premium Clinic Interior

**Timestamp:** 1:00
**Supports:** "This is one patient, one day, one surgeon - who does every single graft himself."
**Purpose:** Establish the premium, boutique nature of the clinic - not a factory, but a precision operation.

### Prompt:

Elegant minimal illustration of a premium medical clinic interior, presented as a sophisticated, architectural visualization against a clean dark background. The composition conveys exclusivity, precision, and single-patient focus.

BACKGROUND:
Solid deep navy-charcoal gradient (#1e2432 at top transitioning subtly to #171c26 at bottom). NO grid lines, NO texture, NO patterns. The background should be completely clean and uncluttered, creating a premium, editorial feeling - like a luxury brand advertisement or high-end architectural rendering. The slight gradient adds depth without distraction.

COMPOSITION:
Central composition with the clinic interior elements arranged to create depth and perspective. The main elements occupy the middle 70% of the frame horizontally and vertically. Generous negative space on all sides creates a sophisticated, breathable layout. The overall impression should be spacious, calm, and exclusive.

ELEMENT 1 - THE SURGICAL CHAIR (CENTER-LEFT):
A single, premium medical/surgical chair rendered as a clean silhouette in soft silver-white (#e8eaed). The chair should be recognizable as a specialized medical reclining chair - not a dentist chair, but a sophisticated surgical positioning chair.

Key shape characteristics:
- Articulated headrest with precise adjustment capability suggested
- Contoured body support section
- Elegant base with hydraulic lift mechanism
- Armrests that appear adjustable
- Overall form language suggesting precision engineering

The chair should be rendered at approximately 300px wide, positioned slightly left of center. Subtle shadow beneath (#0d1117 at 30% opacity) grounds it in space.

ELEMENT 2 - SURGICAL LIGHT (ABOVE CHAIR):
A premium surgical light fixture positioned above the chair, rendered in soft silver-white (#e8eaed) with a subtle warm gold accent (#c9a86c) suggesting the light source.

Key shape characteristics:
- Circular or oval main light head
- Articulated arm suggesting flexibility
- Clean, modern design language
- Gentle glow effect in warm gold at 8-12% opacity around the light head

ELEMENT 3 - INSTRUMENT TRAY (RIGHT OF CHAIR):
A minimalist surgical instrument tray/station to the right of the chair, rendered in soft silver (#e8eaed). Clean lines suggesting precision tools and organization.

ELEMENT 4 - SUBTLE ARCHITECTURAL ELEMENTS:
Very minimal architectural lines suggesting a premium interior space:
- A single vertical line on the left edge suggesting a wall or window frame
- A subtle horizontal line suggesting a floor plane
- All in cool gray (#c5c8cc at 20% opacity)

These should be barely visible - just enough to create spatial context without cluttering.

ELEMENT 5 - TEXT LABEL:
Small, elegant text "ONE PATIENT. ONE DAY." positioned in the lower right quadrant.
- Font: Clean sans-serif (like Helvetica Neue Light or similar)
- Size: 24-28px
- Color: Warm gold (#c9a86c)
- Tracking: Generous letter-spacing (150-200%)

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
The composition tells the story of exclusivity and precision. A single chair in a spacious room communicates "one patient per day" without saying it explicitly. The negative space is the message - this is not a factory, this is a sanctuary.

OVERALL MOOD:
Premium, medical precision, exclusive, calm, spacious. Like a high-end medical brand advertisement or luxury wellness facility.

NOT: Clinical/harsh, crowded, busy, cartoon medical imagery, clip art, stock medical illustration.

## BROLL-03: 10-Run Consistency Test Framework

**Timestamp:** 1:45
**Supports:** "I ran it ten times. That's the protocol. LLM responses vary, so you can't test once and call it done."
**Purpose:** Establish the methodology as rigorous and scientific.

### Prompt:

Elegant minimal diagram illustrating the 10-run consistency test methodology, presented as a sophisticated horizontal flow visualization against a clean dark background. Shows a single query being tested 10 times to reveal true visibility.

BACKGROUND:
Solid deep navy-charcoal gradient (#1e2432 at top transitioning subtly to #171c26 at bottom). NO grid lines, NO texture, NO patterns. Completely clean and uncluttered.

COMPOSITION:
Horizontal flow from left to right, occupying the middle 80% of the frame. The flow shows: Query Input > 10 Test Instances > Result Summary. Elements are vertically centered with generous spacing.

ELEMENT 1 - QUERY INPUT (LEFT):
A minimal search query representation on the left side.
- Rounded rectangle shape suggesting a search bar
- Rendered in soft silver-white (#e8eaed) with 2px stroke, no fill
- Approximately 200px wide, 50px tall
- Text inside: "Query" in cool gray (#c5c8cc), 18px

ELEMENT 2 - FLOW ARROW (LEFT TO CENTER):
A minimal arrow connecting the query to the test runs.
- Thin line (2px) with subtle chevron arrowhead
- Color: Warm gold (#c9a86c)
- Approximately 60px length

ELEMENT 3 - 10 TEST CIRCLES (CENTER):
Ten small circles arranged in two rows of five, representing the 10 test runs.
- Each circle approximately 40px diameter
- Numbered 1-10 in small text (12px) inside each
- Upper row: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Lower row: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
- Spacing between circles: 20px horizontal, 15px vertical

Color coding to show variation:
- Circles 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (odd): Filled with soft silver-white (#e8eaed) - representing "mentioned"
- Circles 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (even): Outlined only in cool gray (#c5c8cc) at 60% opacity - representing "not mentioned"

This creates a visual pattern showing inconsistency - exactly the point of the test.

ELEMENT 4 - BRACKET AND LABEL:
A subtle bracket on the right side of the circles grouping them together.
- Thin line (1px) in cool gray (#c5c8cc) at 60%
- Small label "x10" or "10 RUNS" to the right
- Font: Clean sans-serif, 14px, cool gray

ELEMENT 5 - FLOW ARROW (CENTER TO RIGHT):
Another minimal arrow pointing to the result.
- Same style as Element 2
- Warm gold (#c9a86c), 2px, 60px length

ELEMENT 6 - RESULT INDICATOR (RIGHT):
A result display showing the consistency score.
- Large text "5/10" in soft silver-white (#e8eaed), 72px
- Smaller text "VISIBILITY" below in cool gray (#c5c8cc), 16px
- Or alternatively: "50%" with "CONSISTENCY" below

ELEMENT 7 - METHODOLOGY LABEL (BOTTOM):
Title text anchoring the diagram.
- Text: "THE 10-RUN CONSISTENCY TEST"
- Font: Clean sans-serif, medium weight, 24px
- Color: Warm gold (#c9a86c)
- Positioned at bottom center of the composition
- Generous tracking (150%)

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
The flow reads left to right: one query goes in, gets tested 10 times (with variable results shown), produces a consistency score. The varying fill states of the circles visually demonstrate WHY you need 10 runs - responses vary.

OVERALL MOOD:
Methodical, scientific, professional, trustworthy. Like a research methodology diagram or consulting framework visual.

NOT: Infographic, busy, playful, technical blueprint, spreadsheet-like, chart with axes.

COLOR PALETTE SUMMARY:
- Background top: #1e2432
- Background bottom: #171c26
- Primary elements: #e8eaed
- Secondary/outlines: #c5c8cc at 60%
- Accent/arrows: #c9a86c
- Numbers: #1e2432 (dark, inside light circles) or #c5c8cc (in outlined circles)

## BROLL-08: Globe - Local Only (Problem State)

**Timestamp:** 4:15
**Supports:** "This clinic serves clients worldwide. But their content was entirely focused on Netherlands."
**Purpose:** Visualize the missed opportunity of global positioning.

### Prompt:

Elegant minimal globe illustration showing a localized-only positioning problem, presented as a sophisticated visualization against a clean dark background. The Netherlands is highlighted but the rest of the world is dark/invisible.

BACKGROUND:
Solid deep navy-charcoal gradient (#1e2432 at top transitioning subtly to #171c26 at bottom). NO grid lines, NO texture, NO patterns. Completely clean.

COMPOSITION:
Centered composition with a globe occupying the middle 50-60% of the frame. The globe should be slightly tilted to show Europe prominently.

ELEMENT 1 - GLOBE OUTLINE:
A minimal wireframe or outline representation of Earth.
- Rendered as a circle with subtle latitude/longitude lines
- Main circle: 400-450px diameter
- Stroke: 2px, cool gray (#c5c8cc) at 20%
- A few curved lines suggesting continents/landmasses
- Very minimal - more suggestion than detailed map
- Overall globe should feel dim, underutilized

ELEMENT 2 - NETHERLANDS HIGHLIGHT:
A small highlighted area representing Netherlands on the globe.
- Small shape (approximately 15-20px) in the correct geographic position
- Color: Warm gold (#c9a86c)
- Subtle glow effect (#c9a86c at 15% opacity, 30px radius)
- This is the ONLY bright element on the globe

ELEMENT 3 - REST OF WORLD (DIM):
The rest of the globe/world is intentionally dim.
- Landmass suggestions in cool gray (#c5c8cc) at 15%
- Almost invisible - just enough to show the globe shape
- The contrast with the bright Netherlands makes the "local only" problem obvious

ELEMENT 4 - LABEL FOR NETHERLANDS:
Small label pointing to the highlighted area.
- Text: "NETHERLANDS ONLY"
- Font: Clean sans-serif, 14px
- Color: Warm gold (#c9a86c)

ELEMENT 5 - PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Text at the bottom of the composition.
- Text: "LOCAL CONTENT. GLOBAL CLIENTS."
- Font: Clean sans-serif, medium weight
- Size: 24px
- Color: Soft silver-white (#e8eaed)
- Generous tracking (150%)
- The period creates pause between the two concepts

Alternative layout option:
- "LOCAL" in cool gray (#c5c8cc)
- "CONTENT" in cool gray (#c5c8cc)
- Middle dot or slash as separator
- "GLOBAL" in warm gold (#c9a86c)
- "CLIENTS" in warm gold (#c9a86c)

This creates a visual contrast matching the content vs clients mismatch.

ELEMENT 6 - FADE EFFECT (OPTIONAL):
Subtle vignette or fade around the edges of the globe.
- Darker at edges (#0d1117 at 20%)
- Creates focus on center
- Adds depth without cluttering

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
The eye is drawn to the single golden spot (Netherlands) and immediately notices how much of the globe is dark. The message is clear: they're only visible in one tiny location while their potential market is the entire world.

OVERALL MOOD:
Revealing, opportunity-focused, elegant, geographic. Like a premium strategy presentation showing market opportunity.

NOT: Busy map, infographic style, data points everywhere, cartoon globe, political map colors.
