# Thumbnail Concepts: "0% to 90% AI Visibility in 30 Days (Real Case Study)"

**Video Goal:** Sales + Trust (proof the system works)
**Target Emotion:** "I need to know how they did this" - credibility and curiosity about results

---

## Tournament Summary

| # | Variation | Concept | Advances? |
|---|-----------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | Face + Bold Text | "INVISIBLE" in faded gray, confident face | ✗ |
| 2 | Split/Transformation | 0% → 90% diagonal split with arrow | ✓ |
| 3 | Visual Metaphor | AI visibility gauge at 90% with glow | ✓ |
| 4 | Numbers Focus | Giant "90%" gold with €50K subtle | ✗ |
| 5 | Minimalist | Just "30 DAYS" + knowing expression | ✓ |

**Round 1 Eliminations:**

- **#1 (Face + Bold Text) eliminated:** The word "INVISIBLE" is descriptive and doesn't create enough intrigue. It tells rather than shows. At mobile size, a single word doesn't carry enough weight without supporting visual elements. The transformation story is the hook, not the problem state alone.

- **#4 (Numbers Focus) eliminated:** While "90%" is compelling, leading with JUST the number without transformation context loses the story. Every marketing video has big numbers - this doesn't differentiate. The €50K element could confuse (is this about cost? income?). Also risks looking like typical "income proof" clickbait that business audiences scroll past.

**Round 2 Finalists:**

- **#2 Split/Transformation:** Shows the full journey (0% → 90%) - instantly communicates transformation
- **#3 Visual Metaphor:** Gauge creates intrigue without numbers in title - "what is AI visibility?"
- **#5 Minimalist:** "30 DAYS" is the differentiator - speed promise creates urgency

**Round 2 Winner: #2 (Split/Transformation)**

**Reasoning:**
- **Click worthiness (40%):** The 0% → 90% immediately communicates "real results" to the avatar. Business owners looking for proof will stop.
- **Authenticity (30%):** The transformation format is honest - shows where they were AND where they got to. Not hiding behind vague claims.
- **Proof/credibility (20%):** Actual numbers (0% and 90%) are more credible than generic "success" visuals. The specificity signals real case study.
- **Franchise potential (10%):** This format works for any case study video. Can repeat with different numbers for different clients.

**Runner-up: #5 (Minimalist)** - "30 DAYS" creates urgency and is extremely readable at any size. Strong A/B test candidate.

## WINNER: Split/Transformation

### THUMB-01: The Transformation Journey

**Concept:** Split visual showing 0% → 90% transformation with subtle diagonal divide, representing the invisible-to-visible journey.
**Variation Type:** Split/Transformation
**Emotion Trigger:** "How did they go from nothing to that?" - proof-based curiosity

## Full Imagen Prompt:

Premium YouTube thumbnail showing a dramatic before/after transformation for an AI visibility case study. The composition uses a subtle diagonal split to create visual tension between "invisible" and "visible" states.

**BACKGROUND:**

The frame is divided by a soft diagonal gradient transition running from lower-left to upper-right.

Left portion (30% of frame): Cold, desaturated dark navy (#151a24) representing the "before" state - completely invisible to AI, non-existent. This should feel like shadow, like something fading away or already gone.

Right portion (70% of frame): Warmer premium navy (#1e2432) with very subtle warm undertone representing the "after" state - visible, successful, recommended.

The transition is subtle, not a hard line - approximately 12-15% of the frame width for the gradient blend. This creates an "emerging from shadow into light" feeling.

A very subtle vignette effect around edges (darker at corners, #0d1117 at 8% opacity, 300px feather) to focus attention on center.

NO busy patterns, NO grid lines, NO textures, NO circuit board imagery, NO AI-related icons. Clean and premium only.

**TEXT ELEMENT - "0%" (Left side):**

- Position: Upper left quadrant, 12% from left edge, 22% from top
- Text: "0%"
- Size: Approximately 160px height for the number
- Color: Muted gray (#5a6270) - deliberately "dead" and ghostly feeling
- Font: Bold, clean sans-serif (Inter Black or SF Pro Black style - geometric, modern)
- Effect: Very subtle dark shadow (#0d1117 at 15%) offset 4px down/right for depth
- The text should feel faded, ghostly, almost disappearing
- Slight transparency to text itself (92% opacity) to enhance the "fading" effect

**TEXT ELEMENT - "90%" (Right side):**

- Position: Upper area, right of center, 52% from left edge, 18% from top
- Text: "90%"
- Size: Approximately 200px height - noticeably LARGER than the 0% (signifying growth)
- Color: Warm gold (#c9a86c)
- Font: Bold, clean sans-serif matching the 0%
- Effect: Subtle gold glow behind the text (#c9a86c at 12% opacity, 40px gaussian feather)
- A very thin gold line (1px) at the bottom of the "90" as an underline, extending 30px past each side
- The text should feel vibrant, alive, successful - like it's glowing from within

**CONNECTING ELEMENT - Transformation Arrow:**

- Position: Between the two percentages, vertically centered with them, horizontally bridging the gap
- Style: Clean, thin horizontal line (2.5px) with elegant chevron arrowhead (not rounded, sharp and modern)
- Color: Gradient from gray (#5a6270) on left to gold (#c9a86c) on right
- Length: Approximately 100px
- The arrow represents the transformation journey - from invisible to visible
- Arrow should be subtle, not competing with the numbers for attention

**FACE PLACEMENT ZONE:**

- Position: Right side of frame, centered horizontally in the "success" zone
- Size: Face should occupy approximately 35-40% of frame width
- Vertical position: Centered or slightly above center (face center at approximately 50% from top)
- The face should overlap slightly with the "90%" text - the bottom of the "90%" can be partially behind the shoulder, creating depth layers
- The face is positioned IN the "success" warm zone of the composition, NOT straddling the divide
- Slight soft shadow behind the face (direction: toward the "failure" zone) to separate from background

**Expression needed from photo library:**
- Confident, knowing expression - like you have proof of something others doubted
- Subtle smile (not grinning) - satisfied, not excited
- Direct eye contact with camera
- "I told you so" energy without arrogance
- Eyebrows slightly raised could work - engagement without surprise

**Pose needed:**
- Head and shoulders visible
- Shoulders angled slightly toward camera (10-15 degrees, not square)
- Chin slightly elevated (confidence, not arrogance)
- Professional attire visible at shoulder (blazer or button-up)

**VISUAL HIERARCHY (what the eye sees in order):**

1. Gold "90%" - brightest, largest text element, draws eye first
2. User's face - human connection, credibility
3. Arrow - the journey/transformation (subconsciously processed)
4. Gray "0%" - where it started (completes the story)

**COMPOSITION NOTES:**

- Safe zone: Keep all key elements in center 80% of frame (YouTube UI overlaps corners)
- Bottom right corner will have timestamp - face should not be cut off there
- The diagonal split should feel like "crossing a threshold" not "two separate images"
- Overall balance: heavier on right side (success) - that's intentional
- Text should never touch edges - minimum 5% padding all around

**MOOD:**

This should feel like a reveal - someone who has proof of transformation that others thought impossible. Premium, confident, credible. Like a McKinsey case study cover or a Monocle magazine feature.

The thumbnail says: "I took someone from zero to the top, and I can prove it."

NOT: Flashy, desperate, clickbait, cheap, cluttered, "guru" energy. No shocked expressions, no money imagery, no red arrows, no circles, no "before/after" labels.

**DIMENSIONS:** 1280x720px

**AVOID:**

- Red arrows or circles
- Shocked/exaggerated facial expressions (NO open mouth surprise)
- Money imagery (cash, dollar signs, euro symbols)
- The word "INVISIBLE" or "VISIBLE" as text
- "Before/After" literal text labels
- Screenshots, interface mockups, or app imagery
- Cluttered composition or multiple visual metaphors
- Pure white text (#ffffff) - too harsh
- Neon colors, saturated colors
- Stock photo aesthetic
- AI/robot imagery
- Gradient backgrounds that look like preset PowerPoint themes
- Hair transplant or medical imagery (keep it abstract/business)

## RUNNER-UP: Minimalist/Premium

### THUMB-02: The Speed Promise

**Concept:** Extremely clean thumbnail with just "30 DAYS" as the hook, creating intrigue about what happened in that timeframe.
**Variation Type:** Minimalist/Premium
**Emotion Trigger:** "What can happen in just 30 days?" - urgency and curiosity

---

## Full Imagen Prompt:

Ultra-minimal premium YouTube thumbnail that stands out by NOT competing for attention. Clean, confident, "boring" in Ed Lawrence's terminology - which makes it stop the scroll among cluttered feeds.

**BACKGROUND:**

Solid premium dark navy (#1e2432) across the entire frame. Not gradient, not textured - completely flat and clean.

Very subtle vignette around edges (darker at corners, #0d1117 at 10% opacity, 400px feather) to create slight depth without being noticeable consciously.

The background should feel like expensive presentation software, like a keynote at a premium tech company. Clean enough that a luxury brand would approve.

NO patterns, NO textures, NO gradients, NO visual noise whatsoever.

**TEXT ELEMENT - "30 DAYS":**

- Position: Left side of frame, vertically centered (50% from top), 10% from left edge
- Text: "30 DAYS" (stacked - "30" on top line, "DAYS" on bottom line)
- Size: "30" should be approximately 280px height (massive). "DAYS" should be approximately 100px height below it.
- Color: Warm gold (#c9a86c) for "30", soft silver-white (#e8eaed) for "DAYS"
- Font: Bold, clean sans-serif (Inter Black or similar - geometric, modern)
- Effect: Very subtle gold glow behind the "30" only (#c9a86c at 8% opacity, 30px feather)
- Tracking on "DAYS" slightly widened for premium feel
- "30" and "DAYS" left-aligned with each other
- The "30" should feel like the hero - massive, unavoidable, gold

**FACE PLACEMENT ZONE:**

- Position: Right side of frame, occupying right 45% of width
- Size: Larger than typical - face should feel prominent and confident
- Vertical position: Centered, possibly with slight crop at bottom (chest level)
- The face should NOT overlap with the "30 DAYS" text - clear separation
- Face looking toward camera, NOT toward the text
- Slight distance between face and text (approximately 5% of frame width as buffer)

**Expression needed from photo library:**
- Calm, knowing confidence - "I know something you don't"
- Very subtle smile (almost neutral)
- Direct eye contact
- "Let me show you" energy
- Relaxed face muscles (not tense or performative)
- The expression of someone who has already succeeded and is inviting others in

**Pose needed:**
- Head and shoulders, possibly chest visible
- Body angled slightly (10-15 degrees) toward the text, but eyes at camera
- Chin level or slightly down (approachable, not arrogant)
- Shoulders relaxed, not raised
- Professional but not stiff

**VISUAL HIERARCHY:**

1. "30" - The massive gold number dominates, creates the question
2. User's face - Provides the answer: "I did it"
3. "DAYS" - Completes the timeframe promise

**COMPOSITION NOTES:**

- This is intentionally simple - resist urge to add more
- The negative space IS the design element
- Text and face should feel balanced (text mass on left = face mass on right)
- Bottom 15% of frame stays relatively clear for YouTube UI
- The "boring" aesthetic is the pattern interrupt - everyone else is screaming

**MOOD:**

Calm confidence. The thumbnail equivalent of someone who doesn't need to shout because their results speak for themselves. Premium, understated, credible.

The thumbnail asks: "What happened in 30 days?" The title answers it.

This should feel like Apple's marketing aesthetic - clean, confident, premium. The kind of thumbnail a Harvard Business Review article would use.

NOT: Busy, desperate, loud, cluttered, cheap, "guru" energy, course-seller aesthetic.

**DIMENSIONS:** 1280x720px

**AVOID:**

- Any additional visual elements (no arrows, icons, metaphors)
- Gradients or color transitions
- Multiple text elements beyond "30 DAYS"
- Hair/medical imagery
- Screenshot or proof imagery
- Busy backgrounds
- Drop shadows on text (keep it flat)
- The numbers 0% or 90% (save for winner concept)
- Euro symbols or price points
- Logos or brand marks
- Red or any non-gold accent color

## Expression/Pose Needed

For the **winning thumbnail (Split/Transformation)**, you'll need a photo with:

**Expression:**
- Confident, knowing look - the "I told you so" without arrogance
- Slight smile (corners of mouth turned up, but not teeth showing)
- Direct eye contact with camera
- Eyebrows neutral or slightly raised (engaged, not surprised)
- The look of someone presenting undeniable proof

**Pose:**
- Head and shoulders framing
- Shoulders angled 10-15 degrees toward camera (not square)
- Chin neutral to slightly elevated
- Professional attire visible (blazer or button-up at shoulder)
- Head taking up approximately 60-70% of the space allocated

**Framing:**
- Shot from chest up
- Some space above head (will be cropped in thumbnail)
- Clean background in original photo (easier to composite)
- Good lighting on face (no harsh shadows)

---

For the **runner-up (Minimalist)**, you'll need:

**Expression:**
- Calm, knowing confidence
- Very subtle smile (almost neutral)
- Direct eye contact
- "Let me show you" energy
- More understated than the winner

**Pose:**
- Similar framing but can show more of body
- Body angled toward where text will be, eyes at camera
- Relaxed shoulders
- Could be slightly larger in frame (more presence)

---

## A/B Testing Recommendation

Test these two against each other:

- **Split/Transformation:** Leads with specific numbers (0% → 90%), tells the full story visually
- **Minimalist:** Leads with timeframe (30 DAYS), creates curiosity gap

The Split/Transformation will likely perform better for warm audiences (people who already know about AEO/AI visibility). The Minimalist may perform better for cold audiences (people who don't know what AI visibility means but understand "30 days = fast results").

Recommend running both for first 48 hours with TubeBuddy or similar tool, then committing to the winner.
