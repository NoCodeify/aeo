ChatGPT convinced me to buy a Porsche instead of a BMW.

I've scaled a hair clinic from zero to 10 million dollars. I know how marketing works.

But even I got influenced by an AI. Without even realizing it at first.

Today I'll show you why this matters more than any SEO strategy you've ever learned.

Because if AI can change my mind on a 50k car, imagine what it's doing to your customers right now.

Let me give you some context.

I started with a BMW 320i GT. Drove it for two years. Loved it.

Then I upgraded to a 6 Series. A 650i convertible. Beautiful car. Drove that for another two years.

After I sold it, I knew exactly what I wanted next. A BMW Z4. Staying in the family. Made sense.

But here's where things got interesting.

I'd been using ChatGPT for work. For research. For client projects. And I thought... why not ask it about cars?

So I did.

I told it my preferences. My budget. What I was looking for in a driving experience.

And ChatGPT came back with a suggestion I didn't expect.

A Porsche Boxster.

At first, I pushed back. I'm a BMW guy. That's what I know.

But ChatGPT kept making arguments.

Mid-engine balance. The way a Boxster rotates through corners. The raw driving experience. The fact that Porsche holds its value better than almost any sports car.

And here's the thing that still surprises me.

I bought the Porsche.

A Porsche Boxster S. Nearly a 50k purchase.

And I love it. ChatGPT was right.

But that's not why I'm telling you this story.

The moment I drove that Porsche home, something clicked.

If an AI can convince ME - someone who's been in marketing for years, someone who's naturally skeptical of everything - to completely change my mind on a 50k purchase...

What is it doing to everyone else?

What is it doing to YOUR customers?

See, I'd already spent years helping businesses grow.

I scaled a hair clinic from zero to 5 million dollars with Meta ads. Took three years. Then from 5 million to 10 million with AI chatbots.

I understood how people make decisions. Or I thought I did.

But this was different.

I didn't search Google. I didn't read review sites. I didn't watch comparison videos.

I asked an AI. And I trusted its answer.

That's when I realized: we're watching the biggest shift in how people make buying decisions since the invention of Google itself.

Here's what most businesses don't understand.

You've spent years optimizing for Google. SEO. Paid ads. Building backlinks. Writing blog posts.

And that worked. For twenty years, that was the game.

But now? Millions of people are asking ChatGPT instead.

"What's the best CRM for small businesses?"

"Which hair clinic should I go to in Germany?"

"What car should I buy if I want a fun convertible under 40K?"

And here's the uncomfortable truth.

When ChatGPT answers these questions... most brands don't get mentioned.

They're invisible.

Your competitors might be getting recommended while you're not even in the conversation.

And the worst part?

You have no idea it's happening.

There's no analytics dashboard for this. No ranking report. Google Search Console can't tell you what ChatGPT is saying about your industry.

I call this the AEO problem.

Answer Engine Optimization.

It's not about ranking on Google anymore. It's about being the brand that AI recommends when someone asks a question.

Now, some people will say this is just another marketing trend. Another shiny object.

They're wrong.

Here's why this is fundamentally different.

When you search Google, you see ten results. You can compare. You can click around. You have choices.

When you ask ChatGPT, you often get ONE answer. One recommendation. One brand.

That's not a small difference. That's everything.

The brand ChatGPT recommends has an unfair advantage. They're not competing with nine other options on the page.

They ARE the answer.

Think about what that means for your business.

When someone asks "What's the best..." in your category - is your brand the answer?

Or are you invisible?

---

That Porsche is a daily reminder.

If ChatGPT can change the mind of a stubborn BMW guy like me... it's changing minds in your industry too.

Every single day.

The question is: when someone asks ChatGPT about what you do, are you the brand that gets recommended?

Or are you invisible?

That's why I now focus entirely on AEO. Answer Engine Optimization. Helping brands become THE answer when AI speaks.

Because this isn't the future. This is happening right now.

Here's what I want you to do.

Go ask ChatGPT about your industry right now. Ask it "What's the best..." in your category.

See if your brand gets mentioned.

If it doesn't - and for most of you, it won't - watch my next video.

I'll show you the exact 5-step audit system I use to check any brand's AEO visibility. It's the same process I use with every client.

And you can do it yourself in about ten minutes.

I'll see you in that video.
