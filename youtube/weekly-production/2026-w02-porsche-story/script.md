## FULL SCRIPT (EDITOR-READY)

### HOOK (0:00 - 0:45)

ChatGPT convinced me to buy a Porsche instead of a BMW.

I've scaled a hair clinic from zero to 10 million dollars. I know how marketing works.

But even I got influenced by an AI. Without even realizing it at first.

`[IMAGE: ui-chatgpt-interface.jpeg]`
`[EDITOR: Slow zoom in on the AI response bubble, 3 sec]`

Today I'll show you why this matters more than any SEO strategy you've ever learned.

Because if AI can change my mind on a 50k car, imagine what it's doing to your customers right now.

`[GIF: Mind-blown reaction]`

### SETUP (0:45 - 2:15)

Let me give you some context.

I started with a BMW 320i GT. Drove it for two years. Loved it.

`[IMAGE: timeline-car-journey.jpeg]`
`[EDITOR: Start zoomed on left car (320i GT label visible), hold 3 sec]`

Then I upgraded to a 6 Series. A 650i convertible. Beautiful car. Drove that for another two years.

`[EDITOR: Slow pan right to reveal 650i, hold 3 sec]`

After I sold it, I knew exactly what I wanted next. A BMW Z4. Staying in the family. Made sense.

`[EDITOR: Continue pan right to reveal Z4 + question mark, hold on "?" with slight zoom]`

But here's where things got interesting.

I'd been using ChatGPT for work. For research. For client projects. And I thought... why not ask it about cars?

So I did.

I told it my preferences. My budget. What I was looking for in a driving experience.

`[SCREEN RECORDING: Hands typing ChatGPT query about cars - or use ui-chatgpt-interface.jpeg with typing animation overlay]`

And ChatGPT came back with a suggestion I didn't expect.

A Porsche Boxster.

At first, I pushed back. I'm a BMW guy. That's what I know.

But ChatGPT kept making arguments.

Mid-engine balance. The way a Boxster rotates through corners. The raw driving experience. The fact that Porsche holds its value better than almost any sports car.

`[GIF: Person nodding slowly, being convinced]`

And here's the thing that still surprises me.

I bought the Porsche.

A Porsche Boxster S. Nearly a 50k purchase.

And I love it. ChatGPT was right.

But that's not why I'm telling you this story.

---

### POINT 1: The Realization (2:15 - 3:45)

The moment I drove that Porsche home, something clicked.

`[GIF: Light bulb moment / eureka]`

If an AI can convince ME - someone who's been in marketing for years, someone who's naturally skeptical of everything - to completely change my mind on a 50k purchase...

What is it doing to everyone else?

What is it doing to YOUR customers?

`[STOCK: Person casually asking phone a question - or skip]`

See, I'd already spent years helping businesses grow.

I scaled a hair clinic from zero to 5 million dollars with Meta ads. Took three years. Then from 5 million to 10 million with AI chatbots.

`[IMAGE: chart-revenue-growth.jpeg]`
`[EDITOR: Start at $0 origin, slow pan following the growth line to $5M marker, pause, continue to $10M with slight zoom on final marker]`

I understood how people make decisions. Or I thought I did.

But this was different.

I didn't search Google. I didn't read review sites. I didn't watch comparison videos.

I asked an AI. And I trusted its answer.

`[IMAGE: comparison-google-chatgpt.jpeg]`
`[EDITOR: Start on left side (SEARCH), hold 2 sec, then slow pan right through arrow to AI side, hold on AI 2 sec]`

That's when I realized: we're watching the biggest shift in how people make buying decisions since the invention of Google itself.

### POINT 2: The Problem Most Brands Face (3:45 - 5:15)

Here's what most businesses don't understand.

`[STOCK: Business owner at laptop looking confused - or talking head only]`

You've spent years optimizing for Google. SEO. Paid ads. Building backlinks. Writing blog posts.

`[STOCK: SEO dashboard / analytics screen - or skip]`

And that worked. For twenty years, that was the game.

But now? Millions of people are asking ChatGPT instead.

`[SCREEN RECORDING: ChatGPT mobile app being used - quick 2 sec]`

"What's the best CRM for small businesses?"

"Which hair clinic should I go to in Germany?"

"What car should I buy if I want a fun convertible under 40K?"

`[EDITOR: Add text overlay of each question as you say it - kinetic typography]`

And here's the uncomfortable truth.

When ChatGPT answers these questions... most brands don't get mentioned.

They're invisible.

`[IMAGE: concept-invisible-brand.jpeg]`
`[EDITOR: Start full frame, then slow zoom toward the fading/ghost brands on the edges, 4 sec]`

Your competitors might be getting recommended while you're not even in the conversation.

And the worst part?

You have no idea it's happening.

There's no analytics dashboard for this. No ranking report. Google Search Console can't tell you what ChatGPT is saying about your industry.

`[STOCK: Empty analytics dashboard showing no data - or talking head only]`

I call this the AEO problem.

Answer Engine Optimization.

`[EDITOR: Add "AEO" text animation - bold, gold (#c9a86c), clean sans-serif, scale pop in center of frame]`

It's not about ranking on Google anymore. It's about being the brand that AI recommends when someone asks a question.

`[GIF: Pointing at camera - "That's the key"]`

### POINT 3: Why This Is Different (5:15 - 6:15)

Now, some people will say this is just another marketing trend. Another shiny object.

They're wrong.

`[GIF: Dismissive hand wave / "nope"]`

Here's why this is fundamentally different.

When you search Google, you see ten results. You can compare. You can click around. You have choices.

`[IMAGE: comparison-10-vs-1.jpeg]`
`[EDITOR: Start zoomed on LEFT side only - show the 10 lines and "10 Results" label, circle highlight around the stack of lines, hold 3 sec]`

When you ask ChatGPT, you often get ONE answer. One recommendation. One brand.

`[EDITOR: Quick pan RIGHT to reveal the single gold line and "1 Answer" label, zoom in slightly on the gold line, hold 3 sec]`

That's not a small difference. That's everything.

The brand ChatGPT recommends has an unfair advantage. They're not competing with nine other options on the page.

They ARE the answer.

`[IMAGE: concept-winners-podium.jpeg]`
`[EDITOR: Zoom slowly into the gold 1st place podium, spotlight effect if possible, hold 3 sec]`

Think about what that means for your business.

When someone asks "What's the best..." in your category - is your brand the answer?

Or are you invisible?

---

### PAYOFF (6:15 - 6:45)

That Porsche is a daily reminder.

If ChatGPT can change the mind of a stubborn BMW guy like me... it's changing minds in your industry too.

Every single day.

`[STOCK: Time-lapse of people on phones - or skip to talking head]`

The question is: when someone asks ChatGPT about what you do, are you the brand that gets recommended?

Or are you invisible?

That's why I now focus entirely on AEO. Answer Engine Optimization. Helping brands become THE answer when AI speaks.

Because this isn't the future. This is happening right now.

---

### CTA (6:45 - 7:15)

Here's what I want you to do.

Go ask ChatGPT about your industry right now. Ask it "What's the best..." in your category.

See if your brand gets mentioned.

`[SCREEN RECORDING: ChatGPT query being typed "What's the best [category]..." - real recording]`
`[EDITOR: Or use ui-chatgpt-interface.jpeg with typing cursor animation]`

If it doesn't - and for most of you, it won't - watch my next video.

`[Point to end screen area]`

I'll show you the exact 5-step audit system I use to check any brand's AEO visibility. It's the same process I use with every client.

And you can do it yourself in about ten minutes.

I'll see you in that video.
