1. **Maximum 1 GIF per 45-60 seconds** of video
2. **Duration:** GIFs should loop 2-3 times max (so 1-2 second GIFs ideal)
3. **Position:** Lower third corner, not blocking face
4. **Size:** Small enough to not distract, large enough to notice
5. **Style:** Prefer clean backgrounds, recognizable reactions
6. **Tone:** Professional-ish, not too meme-heavy for origin story

## NOTES

- This is an origin story (Week 1) - keep GIFs relatively professional
- Future videos (roasts, experiments) can be more meme-heavy
- If a GIF doesn't feel right during editing, skip it - B-roll is more important
- Test GIF timing: the reaction should hit RIGHT as the punchline lands
