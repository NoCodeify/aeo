**Date Created:** 2026-01-30
**Target Publish Date:** Week 2
**Video Number:** Week 2 of content calendar (Video 1 - Origin Story)

---

## Video Goal

**Primary Goal:** [X] Views (Growth video - origin story to hook new audience)

**Success Metric:** 10K+ views, high watch time, establishes personal credibility

---

## Video Concept

**Title:** "ChatGPT Convinced Me To Buy a Porsche (I'm Not Mad)"

**Why this title works:**
- Universal hook: Everyone relates to big purchase decisions
- Curiosity: How did AI convince someone? What happened?
- The parenthetical adds personality ("I'm Not Mad" = intrigue)
- AEO/ChatGPT is the REVEAL, not the hook

**Thumbnail Concept:**
- Text: "$50K DECISION"
- Face/emotion: Smirking, slightly sheepish, "I learned something expensive"
- Visual metaphor: Porsche silhouette subtle in corner OR keys/car imagery
- Background: Dark navy (#0A1628)
- Text color: Electric Yellow (#FFE135)

**1+1=3 Check:**
- Title = story setup (AI convinced me to buy)
- Thumbnail = stakes (how much money)
- Together = "This guy spent $50K because of AI advice - I need to know more"

**Angle:** Personal story that demonstrates the power of AI in purchasing decisions, then pivots to "if it changed MY buying decision, what's it doing to YOUR customers?"

**Type:** [X] Origin Story / Personal

## Target Audience

**Who is this for:**
- Stage: Business owners who haven't thought about AI search at all
- Problem they have: Don't realize their customers are asking AI for recommendations
- What they've tried: Traditional marketing, SEO, maybe social media

**Why they'll click:** It's a relatable story about a big purchase decision + curiosity about AI influence

**Why they'll stay:** The pivot from personal story to business implications is unexpected and relevant
