**Date Created:** 2026-02-18
**Target Publish Date:** 2026-02-23 (5 days - catch the search wave)

---

## Search Targeting

**Target Keyword:** sonnet 4.6
**YouTube Trend:** Spiked from 0 to 26 in last 24 hours (just born)
**Volume Anchor:** "claude code" = 500K/month, "sonnet 4.6" = brand new (trending HN #1 with 1,068 points)
**Search Intent:** "Sonnet 4.6 just dropped. Should I care? Is it actually better?"

**Keyword Tier:**
- [x] Tier 3: Emerging (brand new, 24-hour-old search term)

**Secondary Keywords:** sonnet 4.6 review, claude sonnet 4.6, claude code, sonnet 4.5 vs 4.6

---

## Video Goal

**Primary Goal:** [x] Views (ride the trend) + authority (practitioner with real production proof)

**Success Metric:** 10K+ views in first 30 days, positions channel as "the guy who actually builds things" not "the guy who reads changelogs"

---

## The Thesis

**Sonnet 4.5 was the real game-changer. 4.6 is a rounding error.**

We run Sonnet 4.5 in DM Champ ($100K/yr SaaS) as the AI model powering customer conversations. When we switched to Claude/Sonnet 4.5:
- Conversations got dramatically better
- Hallucinations dropped to near zero
- Tool use became reliable
- It actually follows instructions

That was the 10x jump. Sonnet 4.6 is a 1.1x jump on top of something that already works.

**The bigger point:** We've hit the "good enough" plateau for AI models. The bottleneck is no longer the model - it's your implementation. Your prompts, your CLAUDE.md, your agent architecture, your workflow. That's what determines results now. Stop chasing model updates. Start building.

## Title & Thumbnail (1+1=3 Rule)

### Title Options (pick after scripting)

**Option A:** "Sonnet 4.6 Doesn't Matter (Here's What Does)"
(47 chars) - contrarian + redirect

**Option B:** "Why I Don't Care About Sonnet 4.6"
(34 chars) - personal + bold

**Option C:** "Stop Chasing Model Updates (Sonnet 4.6)"
(41 chars) - advice-framed + keyword

**Title Checklist:**
- [x] Keyword present ("Sonnet 4.6")
- [x] Under 60 characters
- [x] Contrarian hook (stands out vs. hype videos)
- [x] Would rank for target keyword

### Thumbnail

**Text (2-3 words):** "DOESN'T MATTER" or "WHO CARES?"
**Hero Color:** [x] Orange #F97316 (contrarian/warning energy)
**Visual Metaphor:** Sonnet 4.6 logo/icon looking small/underwhelming, with a much larger Claude Code terminal or production system icon dominating the frame. The model is small; what you build with it is big.

**Thumbnail Checklist:**
- [x] Text does NOT repeat title words (if using Option A, use "WHO CARES?")
- [x] Readable at 160x90px (mobile)
- [x] Contrarian energy stands out in a feed of hype thumbnails
- [ ] Bottom-right clear for timestamp

**1+1=3 Test:** Title = contrarian take + redirect, Thumbnail = dismissive energy. Together: "Everyone's hyped, this guy isn't - why?" [x] Yes

## Why This Video Wins

**What every other creator will do:**
- Hype the release
- Show benchmarks
- Say "impressive improvement"
- Move on

**What WE do:**
- "Yeah it's fine. But Sonnet 4.5 already did this."
- Prove it with a $100K/yr production system running on 4.5
- Redirect to what actually matters: implementation
- Give viewers something actionable instead of hype

**Our edge:** We have DM Champ running on Sonnet 4.5 in production. Real customers. Real conversations. Real proof that 4.5 is already good enough. Nobody else making Sonnet 4.6 videos has that.

## Structure (Talking Head + Slides, ~8-10 min)

### Hook (0:00-0:30)
**Format:** Pattern interrupt - everyone hypes, you don't

Draft hook:
> "Sonnet 4.6 just dropped. Everyone's losing their minds. Here's my hot take: it doesn't matter. And I say that as someone who runs Claude in production, powering an AI sales agent doing six figures a year. Let me explain."

### The Hype vs. Reality (0:30-1:30)
- Quick: what Anthropic claims (benchmarks, "approaches Opus-level")
- "These are real improvements. I'm not saying Anthropic did a bad job."
- "I'm saying: for anyone already on 4.5, this changes almost nothing."
- Slide: Benchmark chart with a "so what?" overlay or the 95% -> 96% visual

### The DM Champ Story (1:30-3:30) <-- THE PROOF
- "Let me tell you about a real AI system running in production right now."
- DM Champ: AI sales agent across WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, web chat
- What it was like BEFORE Claude: [OpenAI? older model?]
  - Hallucinations - making up products, prices, availability
  - Bad tool use - calling wrong functions, missing parameters
  - Ignoring instructions - going off-script, breaking brand voice
- What happened when we switched to Sonnet 4.5:
  - Conversations got dramatically better
  - Hallucinations basically disappeared
  - Tool use became reliable
  - It follows instructions
  - "That was the real upgrade. That was the 10x moment."
- Slide: Before/after conversation quality (anonymized)
- Slide: Revenue number or customer count

### The Plateau (3:30-4:30)
- "We've hit a plateau. And that's actually a GOOD thing."
- Models are good enough now. Going from 95% to 96% doesn't change your business.
- The era of "wait for the next model to fix my problems" is over.
- "If your AI system isn't working, the model isn't the problem. You are."
- Slide: Diminishing returns curve - big jump at 4.5, tiny bump at 4.6

### Mid-Video CTA: Claudify (~4:15)
- Quick, natural plug
- "This is exactly what we focus on in Claudify - not chasing models, but building real systems that work. Link in the description."
- 10 seconds max. Then straight into the redirect.

### Here's What Actually Matters (4:30-7:00) <-- MID-VIDEO CLIMAX / REDIRECT
This is where the video pivots from "what doesn't matter" to "what does." This is the real value.

**Thing 1: Your prompts and system instructions (4:30-5:15)**
- The difference between a hallucinating AI and a reliable one isn't the model - it's your instructions
- In DM Champ: detailed system prompts, guardrails, response templates
- "Same model, completely different results depending on how you set it up"

**Thing 2: Your tool architecture (5:15-6:00)**
- How you define tools matters more than whether the model scores 2% higher on a benchmark
- Clean tool definitions, proper error handling, clear schemas
- "The model doesn't fail at tool use. Your tool definitions fail the model."

**Thing 3: Your workflow and iteration (6:00-7:00)**
- CLAUDE.md, rules files, agent architecture
- The system around the model matters more than the model
- "I spent more time on my CLAUDE.md than I did choosing which model to use. And that's exactly the right priority."
- Slide: CLAUDE.md snippet or agent architecture diagram

### The Exception (7:00-7:30)
- Be honest: where Sonnet 4.6 DOES matter
- API costs: if you're running Sonnet in production pipelines (not Claude Code where you use Opus anyway), a better Sonnet saves you money vs. upgrading to Opus
- 1M context window: genuinely new capability, worth exploring
- "If you're on the API paying per token, sure, upgrade. But that's not what the hype is about."

### The Bigger Picture (7:30-8:15)
- We're entering the "boring AI" era - and that's great
- When the model isn't the bottleneck, you can focus on building
- "Stop refreshing Twitter for the next model drop. Go build something."
- This ties back to the Claudify mission

### End CTA (8:15-8:45)
- "I built 5 production systems with Claude Code. If you want to see what's possible, watch this video." -> link to W09
- Subscribe + bell
- Claudify link

## Mid-Video Climax

**Timestamp:** 4:30-7:00
**The reveal:** The three things that actually determine whether your AI system works (prompts, tools, workflow) - none of which are the model version
**Why it's surprising:** In a video about Sonnet 4.6, the answer is "the model doesn't matter, YOU matter." This flips the expected frame.
**Visual:** Before/after showing same model with bad vs. good implementation

---

## Proof Elements

**Slides to prepare:**
- [ ] Benchmark chart with "so what?" framing (95% -> 96%)
- [ ] DM Champ before/after conversation quality (anonymized)
- [ ] Diminishing returns curve (big jump at 4.5, flat at 4.6)
- [ ] System prompt snippet (showing how instructions shape output)
- [ ] Tool definition example (clean vs. messy)
- [ ] CLAUDE.md or agent architecture diagram
- [ ] "What matters" summary (3 items)

---

## Timing Strategy

**Ideal publish:** Feb 22-24 (Sat-Mon)
- News channels cover it Feb 18-19 (hype cycle)
- Developer community tries it Feb 19-21 (reality sets in)
- Our video drops when people are thinking "ok but is it actually that different?" (perfect timing for contrarian take)

**Sequence:** This is video #2 (after W09 use cases). W09 establishes credibility ("I built real things"), this video leverages it ("and here's what I learned about what actually matters").

---

## Risk Assessment

**Risk:** At 0-few subs, contrarian takes can feel presumptuous. "Who is this guy to say Sonnet 4.6 doesn't matter?"
**Mitigation:** DM Champ proof. The $100K/yr production system running on 4.5 IS the authority. Lead with proof, not opinion.

**Risk:** Viewers feel baited ("I clicked for Sonnet 4.6 info and got a lecture")
**Mitigation:** Acknowledge 4.6's improvements genuinely in the first 90 seconds. The take isn't "4.6 is bad" - it's "4.5 was already the game-changer."

**Risk:** Alienating Anthropic (you're a Claude Code community leader saying their release doesn't matter)
**Mitigation:** Frame is praise for 4.5, not criticism of 4.6. "You already built something so good that incremental updates feel small. That's a compliment."
