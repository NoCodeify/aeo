## HOOK: CREDIBILITY + CONTRARIAN (0:00-1:00)

| Slide | What You Say |
|-------|------------|
| 01 - TITLE CARD | "I built a SaaS that makes a hundred grand a year. A government access control system. A cold email agent that researches every single company before it writes. All with Claude Code." |
| 02 - YOUTUBE PROBLEM | "But every time I go on YouTube, all I see is people buying 20 Mac Minis to run AI agents locally. Like, what are you doing with your life that you need 20 AI agents running in your closet? And then people building SaaS apps nobody asked for. Nobody uses. That's not building. That's entertainment." |
| 03 - THE PROMISE | "So here are 5 things I actually built with Claude Code that are running in production right now. Real users. Real revenue. No toy projects." |

## USE CASE 1: DM CHAMP (1:00-3:30)

| Slide | What You Say |
|-------|------------|
| 04 - DM CHAMP INTRO | "The first one is DM Champ. It's an AI sales agent. You connect it to your WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, or your website, and it has conversations with your customers. Real conversations. It handles objections, answers product questions, remembers past interactions, and actually closes deals." |
| 05 - THE EVOLUTION | "Now DM Champ didn't start with Claude Code. It started years ago as a prototype inside Go High Level with Zapier. Classic no-code stack. And it worked, but it had limitations. So I moved it to FlutterFlow. Same thing. Hit a ceiling. Then I switched to Cursor. Better, but still not where I wanted it." |
| 06 - CLAUDE CODE ENTERS | "And then I switched to Claude Code. And that's when everything changed. Development just rocketed. Features that would have taken me weeks were coming out in days. The speed was insane. Claude Code just understood what I needed and built it." |
| 07 - CLAUDE AS THE ENGINE | "But here's the other thing. Claude isn't just the tool I used to build DM Champ. Claude IS DM Champ's brain. The AI that powers every conversation. I tested OpenAI, I tested everything else. Claude was the most reliable. It doesn't make things up. It doesn't get confused. When a customer asks about pricing or sends a voice note or shares a photo, Claude handles it. Naturally. Like a real person." |
| 08 - DM CHAMP RESULTS | "DM Champ now makes about a hundred thousand dollars a year. We serve businesses worldwide. Clinics, restaurants, online stores, service businesses. The AI handles their sales conversations 24/7. And Claude Code is why it got there. Not because I had some big team. Not because I raised money. Because the tool was that good." |

## USE CASE 2: CI/CD PIPELINE (3:30-6:30)

| Slide | What You Say |
|-------|------------|
| 09 - THE PROBLEM | "So once DM Champ was running and we had paying customers, I had a new problem. Every bug report, every feature request, every support ticket was coming to me. I was the developer, the support agent, and the project manager. All at the same time." |
| 10 - THE IDEA | "So I thought, what if I just automated the entire thing? Not just the easy parts. The whole pipeline. From the moment a bug comes in to the moment the customer gets a message saying it's fixed." |
| 11 - HOW IT WORKS OVERVIEW | "Here's how it works. A problem comes in. Could be a customer reporting a bug. Could be my team flagging something. Could be the system itself detecting an error automatically. Doesn't matter how it comes in. It all goes into the same pipeline." |
| 12 - STEP 1 | "First, an AI agent reads the ticket and figures out what it is. Is this a bug? A support question? A feature request? It decides and sends it to the right place." |
| 13 - STEP 2 | "If it's a bug, another agent takes over and investigates. It goes through the actual code, looks at what's happening in the live system, and figures out exactly what's wrong and where." |
| 14 - STEP 3 | "Then a developer agent writes the fix. It actually changes the code, tests it, and submits it for review. Like an actual developer would." |
| 15 - STEP 4 | "And then the last agent sends the customer a WhatsApp message and an email saying 'Hey, we found the issue and it's fixed.' Friendly, professional, done." |
| 16 - THE RESULT | "So think about what just happened. A bug came in at 3 in the morning. By the time I wake up, it's investigated, the fix is written, and the customer already got a message on WhatsApp saying it's resolved. I didn't touch anything." |
| 17 - THE SCALE | "And it's not just one agent doing all of this. It's a team of agents, each one specialized in one job. One investigates. One fixes. One talks to the customer. One plans new features. And there's even one that reviews what all the other agents did to make sure nothing went wrong." |
| 18 - AUTOMATED OUT | "I automated myself out of the development process. I just do quality checks now. That's it. I look at the fix, make sure it's good, and approve it. Everything else is handled." |

## USE CASE 3: COLD EMAIL AGENT (6:30-8:00)

| Slide | What You Say |
|-------|------------|
| 19 - COLD EMAIL PROBLEM | "The third thing I built is a cold email agent. Now, I hate cold email. I think most cold email is terrible. You can tell it's a template within two seconds. Everyone knows. Nobody reads that." |
| 20 - WHAT IT DOES | "So I built an agent that actually researches the company before it writes anything. It Googles them. It reads their website. It looks at what they do, what their challenges might be, what's relevant to them. And then it writes a completely personalized email based on what it found." |
| 21 - THE DIFFERENCE | "I'm not talking about one personalized line and then the same pitch underneath. The entire email is different. Every paragraph is about that specific company. What they do, what they're struggling with, why this matters to them specifically. You could put two emails next to each other and you wouldn't even know they came from the same system. Because they're not templates. They're actual letters written for that one company." |
| 22 - WHY IT MATTERS | "And the thing is, building this with Claude Code took me maybe a day or two. That's the part people don't get. This isn't some massive engineering project. It's one agent that Googles, reads, and writes. But the output is something that would take a human 15 to 20 minutes per email. Multiply that by a hundred emails and you start to see why this matters." |

## MID-VIDEO CTA: CLAUDIFY (~8:00)

| Slide | What You Say |
|-------|------------|
| 23 - CLAUDIFY | "Now if you're watching this and thinking I want to build stuff like this, I'm putting together a community called Claudify where we build real projects together with Claude Code. Not toy projects. Real builds. Link is in the description." |

## USE CASE 4: NFC ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM (8:00-11:00) - CLIMAX

| Slide | What You Say |
|-------|------------|
| 24 - TRANSITION | "Alright. Now this next one is on a completely different level." |
| 25 - NFC INTRO | "I built a full access control system using NFC. For the government. A 50 thousand dollar project. Admin dashboard, mobile app, NFC access, the whole thing." |
| 26 - LET THAT SINK IN | "Not a to-do app. Not a landing page. A serious system that controls who gets into a building." |
| 27 - THE PROCESS | "Now I can't share too many details because it's a government project. But here's what I can tell you. 90% of that system was built by Claude Code. The web app, the mobile app, the access logic, who gets in where. All of it." |
| 28 - THE TIMELINE | "It took about two months to get to that 90%. Two months for a government-grade access control system. Then the last 10% took another month. I handed that off to my offshore developers along with Claude, and I just handled QA from that point." |
| 29 - WHY THIS MATTERS | "This is a 50 thousand dollar project that was 90% built by AI in two months. Think about that. And I see people on YouTube using Claude Code to build to-do apps. That's fine, but you're leaving so much on the table." |
| 30 - THE TAKEAWAY | "Whatever you think Claude Code can do, multiply that by ten. If it can build a government access control system, it can build whatever you need." |

## USE CASE 5: AEO SYSTEM (11:00-13:00)

| Slide | What You Say |
|-------|------------|
| 31 - AEO INTRO | "The fifth thing I built is something called an AEO system. Answer Engine Optimization. Now what that means in simple terms is: I built a system that checks whether ChatGPT and Gemini know your business exists." |
| 32 - HOW IT WORKS | "You give it a business name and the system runs queries across ChatGPT, Gemini, and Google. It asks things like 'What's the best [whatever they do] in [their location]?' And it checks: are you in the answer? Are you mentioned? Are you recommended? Or are you completely invisible?" |
| 33 - THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES | "Because here's what most businesses don't realize. People are asking ChatGPT for recommendations every day. Best restaurant near me. Best CRM for small businesses. Best clinic for this procedure. And if you're not in those answers, you're losing business and you don't even know it." |
| 34 - BUILT FOR A CLIENT | "I built this system for a client who pays 2 thousand dollars a month for this service. The system runs the audit, identifies exactly what's wrong, and produces a playbook of exactly what to fix. And I built the entire thing with Claude Code. Multiple agents, each one handling a different part of the audit." |
| 35 - CLIENT RESULTS | "And it works. That client went from being completely invisible in ChatGPT to being recommended as the top option. In 8 weeks. That's the kind of result you can get when you build real tools for real problems instead of building things that look cool on YouTube." |

## THE PATTERN (13:00-14:00)

| Slide | What You Say |
|-------|------------|
| 36 - THE PATTERN | "So what do these five things have in common? They're all in production. They all solve real problems. They all generate revenue or serve real users. None of them were built for a YouTube video. I built them because I needed them." |
| 37 - THE THESIS | "And here's what I've realized after building all of this. Claude Code is the only tool you need. Look at what's happening in the market. OpenAI is doing a million things. Images, video, search, agents, plugins, voice, GPTs. Google is doing the same thing. Spreading everywhere." |
| 38 - ANTHROPIC | "And then there's Anthropic. They're just building one product. And they're making it really, really good. That's it. No distractions. No fifteen different features. Just a tool that works when you point it at a real problem." |
| 39 - THE LESSON | "And that's the lesson. Stop looking for the next tool. Stop switching between ten different AI products. Pick one good one. Point it at a real problem. And build." |
