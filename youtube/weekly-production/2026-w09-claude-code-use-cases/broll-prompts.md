## BROLL-01: Title Card - 5 Real Use Cases

**Timestamp:** 0:36
**Type:** Hub and Spoke
**Supports:** "I built a SaaS that makes a hundred grand a year. A government access control system. A cold email agent..."

### Prompt:

Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style whiteboard diagram showing the title concept "5 Real Use Cases" with five small project icons arranged around the number. The style mimics Excalidraw - imperfect hand-drawn lines, wobbly shapes, handwritten text, casual sketch aesthetic like someone quickly drew this on a whiteboard to explain something to a friend.

BACKGROUND - CRITICAL:
PURE WHITE background. Solid #FFFFFF white. NOT cream, NOT off-white, NOT gray. Absolutely pure white like blank printer paper. NO gradients, NO textures, NO grid lines, NO variation.

OVERALL STYLE - EXCALIDRAW AESTHETIC:
- Lines slightly wobbly, not perfectly straight
- Shapes imperfect - rectangles not quite rectangular, circles not quite round
- Corners don't quite meet perfectly
- "Sketched quickly" quality
- Stroke weight consistent (2-3px equivalent)
- Lines have slight hand-tremor quality
- Text looks handwritten, slightly uneven baseline
- Feeling: casual, authentic, human, NOT polished

LINE QUALITY:
All strokes hand-drawn:
- Slight waviness in every line
- Varying pressure throughout
- Endpoints don't quite connect
- "Drawn with a marker" feel
- Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e)
- Stroke weight: Medium

COMPOSITION:
Centered layout. The hand-drawn number "5" dominates the center of the frame, approximately 250px tall. Written in thick marker strokes, bold and confident but clearly hand-drawn with wobble. Below it, the words "REAL USE CASES" in smaller handwritten text (~40px), slightly uneven baseline. Around the "5", five small sketched icons are arranged in a loose semicircle or scattered arrangement above and to the sides.

ELEMENT 1 - THE NUMBER "5":
Large hand-drawn numeral "5" in dark charcoal (#1e1e1e), centered in the frame at roughly 40% from top. The strokes are thick (4-5px) and clearly hand-drawn with wobble and character. A hand-drawn circle in orange-red (#E07A5F) loosely drawn around the "5" as emphasis, the circle not quite closing, slightly oval. This is the focal point.

ELEMENT 2 - "REAL USE CASES" TEXT:
Below the "5", handwritten text "REAL USE CASES" in dark charcoal (#1e1e1e), approximately 36px. Letters slightly uneven, some taller than others, baseline not perfectly straight. Like someone wrote it quickly on a whiteboard.

ELEMENT 3 - FIVE PROJECT ICONS (arranged loosely around the "5"):
1. Top-left: A simple chat bubble sketch (two curved lines forming a rounded rectangle with a small tail). Represents DM Champ. Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e), approximately 50x40px.
2. Top-right: A circular arrow / loop sketch (a wobbly circle with an arrowhead). Represents CI/CD Pipeline. Same charcoal, same approximate size.
3. Left: A simple envelope sketch (a rectangle with a V-shape inside for the flap). Represents Cold Email Agent. Same treatment.
4. Right: A rectangular card shape with three small curved lines emanating from one corner (NFC signal). Represents Access Control. Same treatment.
5. Bottom: A simple magnifying glass sketch (a wobbly circle with a diagonal line handle). Represents AEO System. Same treatment.

Each icon has a small hand-drawn line (like a spoke) connecting loosely toward the central "5", drawn in gray (#999999) with dashes.

ELEMENT 4 - SMALL LABEL:
At the bottom of the frame, small handwritten text "CLAUDE CODE" in gray (#999999), approximately 18px, like an afterthought note.

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
The loose circle around "5" is the only orange-red (#E07A5F) element. Everything else is charcoal or gray.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Big "5" first, then the icons around it, then "REAL USE CASES" text
- Story: Five real things, here they are, let me explain
- Emotion: Casual credibility, "let me show you what I built"

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Like someone grabbed a marker and sketched this on a whiteboard before a casual meeting

- Text looks handwritten, slightly uneven baseline

LINE QUALITY:
All strokes hand-drawn with slight waviness, varying pressure, marker feel. Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e). Stroke weight: Medium.

COMPOSITION:
Left-center of frame: a simple stick figure standing with arms raised in a shrugging or confused pose. Right-center: a tall, wobbly stack of small flat rectangular boxes (Mac Mini shape - wide and flat, about 80x15px each), stacked roughly 8-10 high, slightly crooked and leaning. The stack looks precarious and absurd.

ELEMENT 1 - STICK FIGURE:
Simple stick figure, about 150px tall. Circle for head (~30px), straight lines for body, arms, legs. Arms raised slightly in a "why?" shrug pose. Drawn in dark charcoal (#1e1e1e). Maybe a small question mark above the head in gray (#999999).

ELEMENT 2 - COMPUTER STACK:
A stack of 8-10 small flat rectangles drawn wobbly, each representing a Mac Mini. Each box approximately 80px wide and 15px tall. Stacked on top of each other but slightly misaligned, leaning a bit.

Horizontal layout centered at approximately 45% from top. A long wobbly horizontal line spans about 80% of the frame width. Four stops marked along this line, evenly spaced, left to right.

ELEMENT 1 - HORIZONTAL TIMELINE:
A hand-drawn horizontal line in dark charcoal (#1e1e1e), slightly wobbly, spanning most of the frame width. Small vertical tick marks at each of the four stops.

ELEMENT 2 - STAGE 1 (GHL + Zapier):
A small hand-drawn rectangle (~90x60px) above the first tick mark. Inside, handwritten "GHL" in dark charcoal, ~18px. Below the tick mark, handwritten "+ ZAPIER" in gray (#999999), ~14px. Below that, a small hand-drawn X mark in gray (#999999), suggesting "didn't work out." The rectangle is drawn with slightly faded strokes, suggesting this is the oldest/dimmest stage.

ELEMENT 3 - STAGE 2 (FlutterFlow):
A small hand-drawn rectangle above the second tick. Inside, "FLUTTER FLOW" in charcoal, ~16px. Below the tick, a small hand-drawn X mark in gray. Same slightly faded treatment as stage 1 but marginally bolder.

ELEMENT 4 - STAGE 3 (Cursor):
A small hand-drawn rectangle above the third tick. Inside, "CURSOR" in charcoal, ~18px. Below the tick, a small "~" or "meh" hand-drawn face in gray. Slightly more visible than stages 1 and 2 but still not the winner.

ELEMENT 5 - STAGE 4 (Claude Code) - FOCAL POINT:
A slightly larger hand-drawn rectangle (~110x70px) above the fourth tick. Inside, "CLAUDE CODE" in dark charcoal, ~20px, slightly bolder strokes. A hand-drawn circle in orange-red (#E07A5F) around the entire rectangle, like someone circled it with emphasis. Below the tick, a hand-drawn checkmark in orange-red (#E07A5F). Small radiating lines (like "aha!" emphasis marks) around the circle.

ELEMENT 6 - ARROWS:
Between each stage, a small hand-drawn arrow pointing right along the timeline, drawn in gray (#999999). Between stage 3 and 4, the arrow drawn slightly bolder or in charcoal, suggesting acceleration.

ELEMENT 7 - ANNOTATIONS:
Below stages 1-3, small handwritten words in gray (#999999): "limits", "ceiling", "better" respectively. Below stage 4, nothing needed - the orange circle says it all.

- "Sketched quickly" quality
- Text looks handwritten

LINE QUALITY:
All strokes hand-drawn with marker feel. Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e). Stroke weight: Medium.

COMPOSITION:
Two horizontal bars stacked vertically in the center of the frame. The top bar is long (taking up ~70% of frame width). The bottom bar is dramatically shorter (~20% of frame width). Both left-aligned. The contrast tells the entire story.

ELEMENT 1 - TOP BAR (WEEKS):
A hand-drawn horizontal rectangle, approximately 70% of frame width, ~55px tall. Outline in dark charcoal (#1e1e1e), no fill or very light gray fill (#999999 at 10%). Inside, handwritten text "WEEKS" in charcoal, ~24px. Above the bar, small handwritten "BEFORE" in gray (#999999), ~14px. The bar has hand-drawn cross-hatching or diagonal lines inside to suggest it is the "old way" - tedious, slow.

ELEMENT 2 - BOTTOM BAR (DAYS):
A hand-drawn horizontal rectangle, approximately 20% of frame width (dramatically shorter), ~55px tall. Same left-alignment as top bar. Outline in orange-red (#E07A5F), filled loosely with orange-red diagonal lines or light shading. Inside, handwritten text "DAYS" in dark charcoal, ~24px. Above the bar, small handwritten "WITH CLAUDE CODE" in gray (#999999), ~14px.

ELEMENT 3 - COMPRESSION ARROW:
A hand-drawn downward arrow on the left side between the two bars, in dark charcoal (#1e1e1e). The arrow suggests compression - weeks squeezed down to days.

ELEMENT 4 - EMPHASIS:
Small hand-drawn radiating lines around the shorter bar, like emphasis marks, in orange-red (#E07A5F). A small handwritten "!!!" next to the short bar in orange-red.

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
The short "DAYS" bar outline and emphasis marks use orange-red (#E07A5F). The long "WEEKS" bar stays in charcoal/gray.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Long bar first (old way), then short bar (new way), then the dramatic contrast
- Story: Massive speed improvement, instantly obvious
- Emotion: "Wow, that's a huge difference"

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Like a quick before/after sketch on a whiteboard
- The length difference is the argument
- No words needed beyond the labels

### Prompt:

Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style whiteboard big number display. "$100K/YR" dominates the frame in large handwritten numerals. Simple, impactful, proof-point energy. The style mimics Excalidraw - imperfect hand-drawn lines, wobbly shapes, handwritten text.

BACKGROUND - CRITICAL:
PURE WHITE background. Solid #FFFFFF white. NOT cream, NOT off-white, NOT gray. Absolutely pure white like blank printer paper. NO gradients, NO textures, NO grid lines, NO variation.

OVERALL STYLE - EXCALIDRAW AESTHETIC:
- Text looks handwritten with thick marker strokes
- Numbers drawn with character and wobble
- "Sketched quickly" quality
- Feeling: casual, authentic, human

LINE QUALITY:
All strokes hand-drawn with marker feel. Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e). Stroke weight: Thick for the number.

COMPOSITION:
The number is the entire slide. Centered both horizontally and vertically. Nothing competes with it.

ELEMENT 1 - THE NUMBER:
"$100K" in very large handwritten text, approximately 200px tall. The "$" drawn slightly smaller than "100K" but still substantial. Drawn in dark charcoal (#1e1e1e) with thick marker strokes (5-6px). The letters have wobble, varying thickness, hand-drawn character. A hand-drawn circle in orange-red (#E07A5F) loosely surrounds the number, not quite closing, slightly oval.

ELEMENT 2 - "/YR":
Below "$100K", handwritten "/YR" in dark charcoal (#1e1e1e), approximately 60px. Slightly lighter stroke weight than the main number.

ELEMENT 3 - SUPPORTING CONTEXT:
Below "/YR", with generous spacing, a hand-drawn wobbly horizontal line in gray (#999999), approximately 200px wide. Below the line, small handwritten text "AI SALES AGENT" in gray (#999999), approximately 18px.

ELEMENT 4 - SMALL DECORATIONS:
A few small hand-drawn dollar signs ($) scattered loosely around the main number in gray (#999999), very small (~15px each), like doodle annotations. Not too many - just 2-3.

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
Only the circle around the number uses orange-red (#E07A5F). Everything else is charcoal or gray.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: "$100K" hits immediately, then "/YR" for context, then "AI SALES AGENT" for what
- Story: Real money, real product
- Emotion: Credibility, proof, "this person makes real money"

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Like someone wrote the revenue number on a whiteboard with a thick marker
- Bold, confident, but still hand-drawn casual
- The number does the talking

## BROLL-21: OpenAI Scattered vs Anthropic Focused

**Timestamp:** 7:55
**Type:** A vs B
**Supports:** "OpenAI is doing a million things... And then there's Anthropic. They're just building one product."

### Prompt:

Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style whiteboard comparison. Left side: many small scattered icons labeled "SCATTERED" (representing doing too many things). Right side: ONE large focused icon labeled "FOCUSED" (representing doing one thing well). The style mimics Excalidraw - imperfect hand-drawn lines, wobbly shapes, handwritten text.

BACKGROUND - CRITICAL:
PURE WHITE background. Solid #FFFFFF white. NOT cream, NOT off-white, NOT gray. Absolutely pure white like blank printer paper. NO gradients, NO textures, NO grid lines, NO variation.

OVERALL STYLE - EXCALIDRAW AESTHETIC:
- Lines slightly wobbly
- Shapes imperfect
- "Sketched quickly" quality
- Text looks handwritten

LINE QUALITY:
All strokes hand-drawn with marker feel. Color: Dark charcoal (#1e1e1e). Stroke weight: Medium.

COMPOSITION:
Frame divided vertically by a hand-drawn dashed line down the center in gray (#999999). Left half shows scatter. Right half shows focus.

ELEMENT 1 - LEFT SIDE (Scattered):
Handwritten "SCATTERED" at the top of the left half, in gray (#999999), ~24px.

Below, 8-10 small hand-drawn icons scattered loosely across the left half. Each icon approximately 30px, drawn in gray (#999999). The icons represent different product categories:
- Camera (images)
- Play button (video)
- Magnifying glass (search)
- Sound wave (voice)
- Chat bubble (chat)
- Puzzle piece (plugins)
- Robot head (agents)
- Code bracket (code)
- Grid (marketplace)

The icons are randomly scattered, not aligned, not organized. Some slightly overlapping. The visual impression is chaos, dilution, lack of focus. All in gray, all small, nothing stands out.

ELEMENT 2 - RIGHT SIDE (Focused) - FOCAL POINT:
Handwritten "FOCUSED" at the top of the right half, in dark charcoal (#1e1e1e), ~24px, bold.

Below, centered in the right half, a SINGLE icon: a hand-drawn terminal/command prompt icon ("> _") drawn in orange-red (#E07A5F), approximately 90px. Much larger than any individual icon on the left. Bold strokes, confident. Small hand-drawn radiating lines around it in orange-red, suggesting energy and purpose.

Below the icon, handwritten "ONE TOOL. DONE RIGHT." in orange-red (#E07A5F), ~16px.

A hand-drawn circle around the terminal icon in orange-red, loosely drawn.

ELEMENT 3 - DIVIDER:
A hand-drawn vertical dashed line down the center of the frame in gray (#999999), separating the two sides.

ACCENT COLOR USAGE:
Only the right side's terminal icon, circle, radiating lines, and "ONE TOOL. DONE RIGHT." text use orange-red (#E07A5F). The left side is entirely gray.

VISUAL NARRATIVE:
- Eye flow: Left (scattered, confusing, eye bounces around), then right (single focal point, eye rests)
- Story: Many things done poorly vs. one thing done well
- Emotion: Clarity of focus vs. confusion of scatter

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Like a strategy lesson drawn on a whiteboard
- The visual experience IS the argument: scatter = confusion, focus = clarity
- Your eye literally can't focus on the left but instantly locks on the right

THIS SHOULD NOT FEEL LIKE:
- Company comparison slide with logos
- Corporate competitive analysis
- Technical feature comparison chart

COLOR PALETTE SUMMARY:

- Emotion: Surprise, delight, mic drop

MOOD AND FEELING:
- Like someone suddenly added one more thing to the whiteboard
- "Oh, one more thing" Apple keynote energy
- Quick, punchy, doesn't overstay

THIS SHOULD NOT FEEL LIKE:
- Video editing timeline
