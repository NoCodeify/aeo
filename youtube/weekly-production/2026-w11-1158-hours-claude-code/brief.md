**Date Created:** 2026-02-19
**Target Publish Date:** TBD (after W09 and W10 are published)

## Search Targeting (COMPLETE FIRST)

**Target Keyword:** claude code
**Search Volume:** 500K/month
**YoY Growth:** +99,900%
**Search Intent:** "How do I actually use Claude Code effectively? What do experienced users know that I don't?"

**Keyword Tier:**
- [x] Tier 2: High Volume (500K/month, +99,900%)

**Secondary Keywords:** claude code tutorial 2026, claude code tips, claude code best practices (+30,450% YouTube growth), vibe coding (500K/mo)

**Format Precedent (proven "hours of" format):**

| Creator | Title | Subs | Views | VPH | Multiplier | Timing |
|---------|-------|------|-------|-----|------------|--------|
| Edmund Yong | 800+ hours... | 143K | 511K | 193 | 14X | 3 months ago (originator) |
| Sajjaad Khader | 1000+ hours... | 262K | 21K | 16 | 1.1X | 1 month ago |
| Andrew Codesmith | 900+ hours... | 56.6K | 146K | 352 | **44X** | 3 weeks ago (most recent) |

**Key insight:** Format still has juice. Andrew's most recent copy performed best relative to channel (44X average). Audience fit and execution matter more than timing. Sajjaad's 262K channel flopped at 1.1X due to audience mismatch.

**Our differentiation:** All three competitors said "learning." We say "building." All three shared tips compilations (memory, commands, MCPs). We show three production systems with proof.

---

## Video Goal

**Primary Goal:** [x] Views (ride proven format) + authority (practitioner with real builds)

**Success Metric:** Outperform channel average by 10X+. Target 50K+ views in first 90 days based on format precedent. Positions channel as "the guy who actually builds things."

---

## Title & Thumbnail (1+1=3 Rule)

### Title

**Primary:** "1,158 Hours of Building With Claude Code in 10 Minutes"
(56 chars) - proven format + "building" differentiator

**Backup options:**
- "1,158 Hours in Claude Code - What Actually Works" (50 chars)
- "1,158 Hours of Claude Code: 3 Production Systems in 10 Minutes" (63 chars - too long)

**Title Checklist:**
- [x] Keyword present ("Claude Code")
- [x] Under 60 characters
- [x] Specific promise (time compression + specific number)
- [x] Would rank for target keyword
- [x] Oddly specific number (1,158 vs round "1000+") feels more credible

### Thumbnail

**Text (3-5 words):** "1,158 HOURS" (big, dominant) - NOTE: this format specifically uses the number as the visual anchor in both title and thumbnail. The 1+1=3 differentiation comes from the visual context around the number, not avoiding the number.

**Icons:** Claude Code terminal icon (purple/orange glow) + code brackets or repo structure visual
**Hero Color:** Purple #8B5CF6 (Claude brand) or Orange #F97316 (energy/urgency)
**Style:** Minimal Apple aesthetic - pure black background, glossy 3D icon, Porsche font ALL CAPS, smooth chrome gradient on text

**Thumbnail Checklist:**
- [x] Readable at 160x90px (mobile) - big number dominates
- [x] No faces (channel <2K subs)
- [x] Bottom-right clear for timestamp
- [x] Matches proven format visual language

**1+1=3 Test:** Title = credibility (1,158 hours) + differentiation (building, not learning). Thumbnail = the number as visual anchor + Claude Code icon context. Together: "This person built real things for 1,158 hours and compressed it." [x] Yes

## Stakes-Based Structure (NOT Logical Order)

**Order content by URGENCY, not logic. Each section should make viewers MORE anxious.**

### Hook: Answer the Query (0:00-0:40)
**Search intent answer:** Most of what people teach about Claude Code is already outdated. After 1,158 hours I built three production systems - a $100K/yr SaaS, a government access control system, and a full business operating system with 14 agents. This is everything I learned.
**Retention hook:** "There's one thing everyone recommends that made everything worse."

### Section 1: Where Everyone Starts (0:40-2:15)
**The entry point:** DM Champ - existing codebase, $100K/yr revenue. Just init and go. Claude handles messy codebases (FlutterFlow export). Built 6 autonomous agents on top as a separate microservice. Basic CLAUDE.md, no fancy setup.
**Stakes:** You don't need a perfect setup to start. But staying here = leaving massive potential on the table.
**Visual proof:** Screen recording of terminal init, agent repo structure, basic CLAUDE.md

### Section 2: The Mistake That Costs Weeks (2:15-3:30)
**Escalate stakes:** Tried letting Claude build autonomously end-to-end. Doesn't work for production. The bottleneck is QA - UI testing takes AI 15 minutes for what takes a human 1 minute. Full autonomy = bugs in production.
**Why it's urgent:** Everyone's being told to "let AI do everything." If you follow that advice on a real project, you'll waste weeks debugging AI-generated code that technically compiles but doesn't work.
**Visual proof:** No specific visual needed - this is a story beat

### Section 3: The Structure Unlock (3:30-5:15)
**The insight that changes everything:** Feature-per-folder. Per-feature CLAUDE.md with business context, endpoints, schemas. In-repo task management (107 markdown task files instead of Jira). Claude is only as good as the context you give it.
**Quantify the cost:** Government project - 8,327 files, 15 backend features, 12 frontend features, 27 per-feature CLAUDE.md files. This structure is what made a government-grade system possible with AI.
**Visual proof:** Screen recording of features/ folder, per-feature CLAUDE.md, TASKS/ directory

### MID-CTA (~5:15)
Claudify plug. Brief, natural. "If you want to set up Claude Code for real projects, Claudify. Link in description."

### Section 4: The Business OS Reveal (5:25-7:50) - CLIMAX ZONE
**The "holy shit" moment:** One repo running an entire business. 7 custom MCP servers built from source. 14 task-specific agents (not role agents - that failed). 24 skills. A 346-line MAINTAINING.md for evolving the AI system itself. The workflow has changed 4 times in less than a year.
**Why it's surprising:** Viewers expect tips. Instead they see an entire business infrastructure managed by Claude Code - consulting, YouTube, SaaS, client delivery, all from one repo.
**Visual proof:** Screen recording of .mcp.json (7 servers), agents/ folder (14 agents), MAINTAINING.md scrolling

### Section 5: The Trap (7:50-8:30)
**Payoff of retention hook:** Everyone says add all the MCP servers, all the skills, all the plugins. I tried it. Claude got confused. Quality went down. The real rule: start with nothing, add only when you feel the pain of not having it. Less is more until it isn't.
**Why save this for late?** It's the answer to the hook promise. Viewers have been waiting for this since 0:30.

### Section 6: Summary + CTA (8:30-9:30)
**Three stages recap:** Init and go. Structure everything. Build a system.
**Single takeaway:** The difference between 10 hours and 1,000 hours is knowing which features to ignore.
**CTA:** Claudify for the actual repo structures, agent configs, and workflows. Subscribe.

## Mid-Video Climax (REQUIRED)

**Timestamp:** 5:25-7:50
**The reveal:** One repo, 1,066 files, running an entire business through Claude Code. Not a project - a business operating system. 7 custom MCP servers, 14 agents, 24 skills. Plus: the workflow has fundamentally changed 4 times in less than a year.
**Visual:** Screen recording montage - .mcp.json, agents/ folder, skills/ folder, MAINTAINING.md
**Why it's surprising:** Every other "hours of Claude Code" video shows tips for using Claude Code on a single project. This shows Claude Code running a multi-domain business (consulting + YouTube + SaaS + client delivery).

**Climax Checklist:**
- [x] Happens at 5:25-7:50
- [x] Is VISUAL (screen recordings of actual repo)
- [x] Is SURPRISING (business OS, not project tips)
- [x] RESOLVES the tension (this is what 1,158 hours actually looks like)

## Script Principles Checklist

- [x] **Answer query in 30 seconds** - "Most of what people teach is outdated. Here's what 1,158 hours actually taught me."
- [x] **Order by stakes, not logic** - Autonomy trap (urgent mistake) before structure unlock (solution)
- [x] **Mid-video climax planned** - Business OS reveal at 5:25-7:50
- [x] **Show, don't explain** - 10 screen recordings as visual proof
- [ ] **40% deletion target** - Apply after first script draft
- [x] **Earned credibility** - $100K/yr SaaS, government project, business OS shown before any claims

## Competitor Differentiation

| What They Do | What We Do |
|---|---|
| "800/900/1000+ hours of LEARNING" | "1,158 hours of BUILDING" |
| Tips compilation (memory, commands, MCPs) | Three-repo progression story with proof |
| Generic advice anyone could give | Screen recordings of actual production repos |
| Round numbers (feel estimated) | 1,158 (feels tracked, specific) |
| One project context | Three production systems ($100K SaaS, government, business OS) |
| "Here's a cool feature" | "Here's what I built and what broke" |

## Brain Dump / Raw Material for Script Writer

**From user interviews (direct quotes/paraphrases to work into script):**
- "You just load Claude, open the repo, and run init. That's it."
- "What works best is one feature per folder so AI can get all the context"
- "We have a claude.md in each feature that describes what it's about and its status"
- "We do project management inside the repo. Tasks directory with statuses."
- "For something like a unit test, it's very basic. UI tests are very slow and context-heavy. What takes a human a minute takes AI 15 minutes."
- "We tried letting Claude fully autonomously build out an entire project. That doesn't work."
- "Claude Code doesn't really work 'with' a team. All developers have their own instances."
- "Old information is often not useful. The workflows keep changing."
- "Initially you had to approve every edit. Then bypass permissions. Then plan mode. Now you just say 'go into plan mode.'"
- "I tried adding all kinds of MCPs and skills, but that is not needed anymore" (early overload)
- "Just like in software engineering where you build technical debt, you need to do the same for a Claude Code repo"
- "It built a whole feature in five minutes that would normally have taken a developer a few days"
- Sub-agents: task agents work, role agents don't

**Three repos as source material:**
1. `/Users/sohaib/Documents/GitHub/DM Champ` - Flutter + Firebase, FlutterFlow export, $8.3K/mo, basic CLAUDE.md
2. `/Users/sohaib/Documents/GitHub/dm-champ-agents` - 6 agents, 4 custom MCPs, Claude Agent SDK, 12K lines TS
3. `/Users/sohaib/Documents/GitHub/access-control-system` - 8,327 files, 15 backend features, 27 per-feature CLAUDE.md files, 107 task files, 15 agents, 5 skills, 3 commands
4. `/Users/sohaib/Downloads/aeo` - 1,066 files, 14 agents, 24 skills, 7 MCP servers, 346-line MAINTAINING.md
