# Thumbnail Imagen Prompts: W2-W7

Generated: 2026-01-31

## Workflow

**Input:** Full freeze frame from video (you already in frame)
**Output:** Imagen adds text, effects, visual elements ON TOP of the freeze frame

Imagen will:
1. Keep your face/expression exactly as-is
2. Apply cinematic color grading to match brand palette
3. Add professional text with proper effects
4. Add visual metaphors/elements that integrate naturally
5. Reposition you slightly to the right if needed for text space

## Professional Text Specifications (ALL THUMBNAILS)

**Font Style:** Heavy condensed impact-style (think Bebas Neue Black, Oswald Heavy, or Impact)

**Text Effects Stack (applied to ALL text):**
1. **Fill:** Solid color (white, yellow, or red per video)
2. **Inner shadow:** Subtle depth (2px, 45°, dark version of fill color)
3. **Stroke:** 4-6px black outline (#000000) for pop against any background
4. **Drop shadow:** Heavy black shadow (8px offset, 15px blur, #000000 at 80%)
5. **Outer glow:** Subtle color glow matching fill (20px feather, 15% opacity)

**This creates text that:**
- Pops off ANY background
- Has depth and dimension
- Looks cinematic, not flat
- Reads clearly at mobile size

---

## Color Grading (Applied to Freeze Frame)

**Brand Look:** Dark, cinematic, premium

**Adjustments to apply:**
- Crush blacks slightly (lift black point to #0A1628)
- Desaturate midtones 10-15%
- Add subtle teal to shadows (#00D4FF at 5%)
- Add subtle warmth to highlights
- Increase contrast
- Add dark vignette around edges

**Result:** Your freeze frame looks like a Netflix thumbnail, not a webcam screenshot.

Keep the person exactly as they appear but ensure they're positioned on the RIGHT 40% of the frame. If they're centered, shift the composition so there's space on the left for text.

Apply cinematic color grading - crush the blacks to deep navy (#0A1628), add slight teal tint to shadows, warm the skin tones subtly, increase contrast. Add a dark vignette around all edges. The overall feel should be premium and cinematic, like a movie poster.

### Imagen Prompt:

Take this freeze frame and transform it into a premium YouTube thumbnail.

SUBJECT POSITIONING:
Person on RIGHT side (40% of frame), looking serious and concerned. They're delivering sobering news.

COLOR GRADE THE IMAGE:
Serious, slightly foreboding. Deep navy blacks (#0A1628), slight red/warning undertone in the shadows on the LEFT side of frame (where the "losing" happens). Cool overall with subtle warmth on the person (they're the "safe" messenger). Heavier vignette than usual.

TEXT - "HALF ARE":
- Position: Upper-left, 8% from left, 15% from top
- Text: "HALF ARE"
- Size: Medium - about 14% of frame height

- Points down-right, toward the concept of loss

SUBTLE SPLIT EFFECT:
The left 55% of the frame should have a slightly cooler, more ominous grade. The right 45% (where the person is) should be more neutral. This creates subconscious "bad side / safe side" division.

OVERALL MOOD:
Data-backed concern, not clickbait panic. "I did the research and you need to know this." Serious journalism energy, not fear-mongering.

AVOID:
- Shocked/screaming expression
- Skull or death imagery
- Multiple red warning elements
- "50%" text (title already has the stat)
