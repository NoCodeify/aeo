## BROLL-01: LLM Randomness (Slot Machine)

**Timestamp:** 0:33
**Supports:** "Most businesses test their AI visibility once. That's like flipping a coin and calling it research."

### Prompt:

Elegant minimal illustration showing three slot machine reels frozen mid-spin, each displaying different brand names, representing the randomness of LLM responses. The composition conveys that asking ChatGPT the same question yields different answers each time - like playing a slot machine.

**BACKGROUND:**
Solid deep navy-charcoal gradient (#1e2432 at top transitioning subtly to #171c26 at bottom). NO grid lines, NO texture, NO patterns, NO casino-style decorations. Premium, sophisticated feeling.

**COMPOSITION:**
Centered layout with three vertical rectangular reels arranged horizontally. Each reel approximately 180px wide by 400px tall. Full arrangement spans roughly 600px total width.

### Prompt:

Elegant minimal illustration showing five search query bubbles radiating outward from a central brand logo placeholder, representing the "Dream Queries" concept.

**BACKGROUND:**
Solid deep navy-charcoal gradient (#1e2432 to #171c26). Clean and uncluttered.
