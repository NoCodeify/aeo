**Target Publish Date:** Week 3 (2026-01-20 - 2026-01-26)
**Video Number:** Week 3 of content calendar

## Video Goal

**Primary Goal:** [x] Sales

**Success Metric:** Viewers request an AEO audit or DM for consultation. Target: 5+ qualified leads from this video.

---

## Video Concept

**Title:** "The 5-Step AEO Audit System I Use With Every Client"

**Thumbnail Concept:**
- Face/Emotion: Confident, slightly serious, pointing at checklist
- Text (3 words max): "5-STEP AUDIT"
- Visual metaphor: Clipboard with checkmarks, brands fading in/out of ChatGPT interface

**Angle:** Give away the exact system so viewers trust you enough to hire you

**Type:** [x] System/Method (40% sales effectiveness per Ed Lawrence data)

---

## Target Audience

**Who is this for:**
- Stage: Business owners/marketers who've heard of AEO but don't know how to assess their visibility
- Problem they have: They suspect their brand is invisible to AI but have no way to verify or fix it
- What they've tried: Traditional SEO, maybe typed their brand into ChatGPT once

**Why they'll click:** They want the actual system, not theory. "5-Step" promises actionable structure.

**Why they'll stay:** Each step reveals something they didn't know about how LLMs work. The 10-run consistency test is mind-blowing (most people run queries once).

---

## Key Points to Cover

1. **Step 1: Client Intake Questionnaire**
   - Story/example: "The first question I ask every client: What 5 queries would you MOST want to appear for?"
   - Visual metaphor: Form being filled out, dream queries appearing as search bubbles

2. **Step 2: First 50 Words Audit**
   - Story/example: Show a real website that starts with "Unlock the power of..." vs one that states WHO/WHAT/WHERE/PRICE immediately
   - Visual metaphor: LLM truncating after 50 words, red X vs green checkmark

3. **Step 3: 10-Run Consistency Test**
   - Story/example: Live demo - run "best hair transplant Europe" 10 times, show different results each time
   - Visual metaphor: Slot machine/dice showing randomness, then consistency score appearing

4. **Step 4: Discovery Query Mapping**
   - Story/example: "Your brand name queries don't matter if nobody knows you exist. Here's what to test instead."
   - Visual metaphor: Map with query categories radiating from center

5. **Step 5: Playbook Creation**
   - Story/example: Show actual playbook structure - Week 1 critical, Week 2 high, Month 1 medium
   - Visual metaphor: Audit document transforming into action checklist

## Proof Elements

**Numbers to share:**
- 100 queries minimum per audit (5 queries x 10 runs x 2 LLMs)

- Most brands fail the First 50 Words test

**Screenshots/recordings needed:**
- ChatGPT interface showing same query returning different results

**B-roll needs:**
