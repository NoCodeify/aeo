**Updated:** 2026-01-30 (Universal hook title + thumbnail style guide)

## Video Goal

**Primary Goal:** [X] Sales

**Success Metric:** Viewers request an AEO audit or DM for consultation. Target: 5+ qualified leads from this video.

---

## Video Concept

**Title:** "How I Find Out If AI Knows Your Business Exists"

**Why this title works:**
- Universal fear trigger: "Does AI know I exist?" (everyone wonders this)
- Not niche jargon (no "AEO Audit System")
- Positions YOU as the expert who can find out
- Curiosity gap: What's the method? What happens if AI doesn't know?

**OLD Title (killed):** "The 5-Step AEO Audit System I Use With Every Client"
- Process-focused (about YOUR method, not THEIR problem)
- Jargon ("AEO Audit System")
- No emotional hook

**Thumbnail Concept:**
- Text: "ARE YOU INVISIBLE?"
- Face/emotion: Concerned, questioning look
- Visual metaphor: Ghost effect OR faded/transparent business logo
- Background: Dark navy (#0A1628)
- Text color: White with "INVISIBLE" in Yellow (#FFE135)

**1+1=3 Check:**
- Title = promise (I can find out if AI knows you)
- Thumbnail = fear trigger (you might be invisible)
- Together = "I might be invisible to AI and this guy can tell me"

**Angle:** Give away the exact system so viewers trust you enough to hire you

**Type:** [X] System/Method

---

## Target Audience

**Who is this for:**
- Stage: Business owners/marketers who've heard of AI search but don't know how to assess their visibility
- Problem they have: They suspect their brand is invisible to AI but have no way to verify or fix it
- What they've tried: Traditional SEO, maybe typed their brand into ChatGPT once

**Why they'll click:** Fear of being invisible + someone who can diagnose it

**Why they'll stay:** Each step reveals something they didn't know about how LLMs work. The 10-run consistency test is mind-blowing.

## Key Points to Cover

1. **Step 1: Client Intake Questionnaire**
   - Story: "The first question I ask: What 5 queries would you MOST want to appear for?"
   - Visual: Form being filled out, dream queries appearing

2. **Step 2: First 50 Words Audit**
   - Story: Show a website that starts with "Unlock the power of..." vs one that states WHO/WHAT/WHERE/PRICE
   - Visual: LLM truncating after 50 words, red X vs green checkmark

3. **Step 3: 10-Run Consistency Test**
   - Story: Live demo - run "best hair transplant Europe" 10 times, show different results
   - Visual: Slot machine showing randomness, then consistency score

4. **Step 4: Discovery Query Mapping**
   - Story: "Your brand name queries don't matter if nobody knows you exist."
   - Visual: Map with query categories radiating from center

5. **Step 5: Playbook Creation**
   - Story: Show actual playbook structure - Week 1 critical, Week 2 high
   - Visual: Audit document transforming into action checklist

---

## Proof Elements

**Numbers to share:**
- 100 queries minimum per audit (5 queries x 10 runs x 2 LLMs)
- FueGenix increased from 0/10 to 8/10 consistency
- Most brands fail the First 50 Words test

**Screenshots/recordings needed:**
- ChatGPT interface showing same query returning different results
- Before/after first 50 words examples
- Actual playbook document (redacted)
- Consistency score spreadsheet

**Client examples:**
- FueGenix case study data
- Anonymous "Brand X" examples for fails

## CTA Strategy

**Next video to point to:** "This Business Was Invisible To AI. 30 Days Later, It's #1." (Week 4 Case Study)

**End screen setup:** Point to case study showing the system in action

---

## Production Notes

**B-roll needs:**
- AI-generated diagrams for each of the 5 steps
- Form/questionnaire visual
- 50-word truncation diagram
- Slot machine/dice randomness visual
- Query map diagram
- Audit-to-playbook transformation visual

**GIF moments:**
- After revealing 10-run consistency test (mind blown)
- After showing "Unlock the power of..." fail (disappointed)
- After playbook reveal (excited/productive)

**Special requirements:**
- Live screen recording of running a query 10 times in ChatGPT
- Redacted playbook document screenshot
