## HOOK TOURNAMENT

### Round 1: Generate 6 Hooks

**Hook 1: Controversial Statement**
> Line 1: "Most brands are completely invisible to ChatGPT. And the scary part? They have no idea."
> Line 2: "I've audited over 50 brands for AI visibility. The results are always the same."
> Line 3: "You've done SEO. You've got traffic. But when someone asks ChatGPT for a recommendation in your space, you don't exist."
> Line 4: "Today I'm giving you the exact 5-step audit system I use with every client to find out if AI is hiding their brand."
> Line 5: "And step 3 is going to completely change how you think about search."

**Hook 2: Surprising Statistic**
> Line 1: "I ran the same search query in ChatGPT 10 times. Got 10 different answers."
> Line 2: "This is why I run 100 queries minimum in every audit I do."
> Line 3: "Most businesses test their AI visibility once. That's like flipping a coin and calling it research."
> Line 4: "I'm going to show you the 5-step audit system I use to find out if ChatGPT is actually recommending your brand."
> Line 5: "Step 2 takes 30 seconds and most brands fail it immediately."

**Hook 3: Provocative Question**
> Line 1: "What if ChatGPT is actively hurting your business right now and you don't even know it?"
> Line 2: "I scaled a hair clinic from zero to 15 million euros. Half of that came from AI visibility."
> Line 3: "The brands winning in 2026 aren't just SEO-optimized. They're AI-optimized."
> Line 4: "I'm going to walk you through my exact 5-step AEO audit system. The same one I use with every client."
> Line 5: "And I'll show you the one test that reveals whether AI is helping or ignoring you."

**Hook 4: Specific Result**
> Line 1: "One of my clients went from zero ChatGPT mentions to 8 out of 10 in 30 days."
> Line 2: "How? I ran them through this 5-step audit system."
> Line 3: "See, most brands think they're visible to AI because they rank on Google. They're wrong."
> Line 4: "Today I'm breaking down every step of my AEO audit so you can run it yourself."
> Line 5: "Including the counterintuitive fix in step 2 that makes ChatGPT finally notice you."

**Hook 5: Relatable Frustration**
> Line 1: "You've spent years on SEO. You rank on page one. But ChatGPT doesn't even know your brand exists."
> Line 2: "I see this every single week in my audits."
> Line 3: "Business owners who've done everything right for Google but are completely invisible to AI."
> Line 4: "So I built a 5-step system to find out exactly where brands are failing and how to fix it."
> Line 5: "And the first step? It's the one question most agencies never ask."

**Hook 6: Contrarian Take**
> Line 1: "Stop typing your brand name into ChatGPT. That test is useless."
> Line 2: "I've run thousands of AI visibility audits. Here's what actually matters."
> Line 3: "Your branded queries mean nothing if nobody knows you exist in the first place."
> Line 4: "Today I'm showing you my 5-step audit system that reveals if ChatGPT is recommending you when it counts."
> Line 5: "Step 4 is the one everyone skips. It's also where the money is."

- Hook 6: Contrarian "stop doing X" is pattern interrupt, actionable
- **Winner: Hook 6** - Contrarian hooks grab attention faster

**Advancing to Semi-Finals:** Hooks 2, 4, 6

---

### Round 2: Semi-Finals (3 -> 1)

**Hook 2** (10 different answers)
- Goal Alignment: 9/10 - Shows depth of audit methodology
- Curiosity Gap: 10/10 - "Why 10 times?" creates need to know
- Natural Flow: 8/10 - Sets up 10-run test perfectly
- Authentic Voice: 9/10 - Data-driven, specific

**Hook 4** (0 to 8/10 result)
- Goal Alignment: 10/10 - Specific client result drives sales
- Curiosity Gap: 7/10 - Good but "how" is predictable
- Natural Flow: 8/10 - Sets up system well
- Authentic Voice: 8/10 - Results-focused

**Hook 6** (Stop testing brand name)
- Goal Alignment: 8/10 - Contrarian but less direct to audit
- Curiosity Gap: 8/10 - "What should I test instead?"
- Natural Flow: 7/10 - Have to pivot to system structure
- Authentic Voice: 9/10 - Opinionated expert

**WINNER: Hook 2**
- The "10 different answers" insight is genuinely surprising
- Naturally leads into the 10-run consistency test (Step 3)
- Shows expertise without being salesy
- Creates immediate curiosity about the rest of the system

## FINAL SCRIPT

---

### HOOK (0:00 - 0:45)

**[WHY THIS HOOK WON]:** The 10-run test insight is unique, surprising, and immediately shows depth of expertise. It creates a "wait, what?" moment that demands explanation. Also naturally sets up Step 3.

**Line 1: Pattern Interrupt**
> I ran the same search query in ChatGPT 10 times. Got 10 different answers.

**[B-ROLL: Screen recording showing 10 different ChatGPT responses to same query]**

**Line 2: Credibility**
> This is why I run 100 queries minimum in every audit I do.

**Line 3: Empathy**
> Most businesses test their AI visibility once. That's like flipping a coin and calling it research.

**[B-ROLL: Slot machine reels showing different brand names - visualizing LLM randomness]**

**Line 4: Promise**
> I'm going to show you the 5-step audit system I use to find out if ChatGPT is actually recommending your brand.

**Line 5: Teaser**
> Step 2 takes 30 seconds and most brands fail it immediately.

---

### SETUP (0:45 - 2:15)

**Establish the Problem**
> Here's what most people do when they want to check their AI visibility.

> They open ChatGPT. They type their brand name. They see a response. And they say "Great, ChatGPT knows us. We're good."

> That test has two major problems.

**[B-ROLL: Someone typing brand name into ChatGPT, getting a response, looking satisfied]**

> I learned this working with a hair transplant clinic. They typed their name into ChatGPT and it responded. Great, right? Except the information was completely wrong. Outdated pricing from 5 years ago. Claims pulled from random Reddit threads and old forum posts. ChatGPT was confidently telling potential patients things that hadn't been true for years.

> Problem one: just because ChatGPT responds doesn't mean it's accurate.

> Then I ran the queries that actually bring in new customers - "best hair transplant in Europe," "top FUE surgeon" - and they weren't mentioned at all.

> Problem two: branded queries only matter after someone already knows you exist.

> So they had the worst of both worlds. Wrong information when people searched their name. And zero visibility when people searched for solutions.

> Most businesses only test the first part. They never test the second. And that's where the real money is.

**Create Tension**
> And here's the uncomfortable truth.

> ChatGPT's responses are non-deterministic. That's a fancy way of saying: the same question can give different answers every single time.

> This isn't a bug. This is how LLMs work. They sample from probability distributions. They're creative. And that creativity means inconsistency.

> So that one test you ran? It might have been the only time you showed up. Or the only time you didn't.

> You have no idea.

**[GIF: Person looking confused/concerned]**

> That's why I developed a 5-step audit system that gives you real data. Not hope.

> Let me walk you through exactly how it works.

---

### MAIN CONTENT

---

### Step 1: The Client Intake Questionnaire (2:00 - 3:30)

**Story/Example**
> The first thing I do with every client - before I run a single query - is ask them one question.

> "What 5 queries would you MOST want to appear for when someone searches in ChatGPT?"

> Not "what keywords do you rank for on Google." Not "what's your brand name."

> What queries do you want to OWN?

**[B-ROLL: Questionnaire form with "Dream Queries" section highlighted]**

**Framework Explanation**
> I call these Dream Queries. And they become the foundation of everything else.

> Because here's what most agencies do wrong. They audit what you already rank for. That's backwards.

> Dream Queries force you to think about where you WANT to be found. Not where you are.

> Things like "best hair transplant in Europe" or "premium AI consulting firm" or "what's the safest option for my surgery."

**[B-ROLL: Dream queries appearing as search bubbles radiating from a central brand logo]**

**Mini-Tension**
> But collecting Dream Queries is just the starting point.

> Because once I have those queries, I need to see if your website is even capable of ranking for them.

> And that's where step 2 comes in. The one that takes 30 seconds and fails 80% of brands I audit.

---

### Step 2: The First 50 Words Audit (3:30 - 5:30)

**Story/Example**
> Pull up your homepage right now. Read the first 50 words.

> If it starts with something like "Unlock the power of innovation" or "In today's competitive landscape" or "Are you ready to transform your business?" - you have a problem.

**[B-ROLL: Example website with vague opening text, red X overlay]**

> LLMs process text sequentially. They often truncate after the first chunk of content. And they definitely lose focus.

> So if your first 50 words don't tell them WHO you are, WHAT you do, WHERE you're located, and HOW MUCH you charge - you're invisible.

**Framework Explanation**
> I call this the First 50 Words Test. And it's brutally simple.

> Here's a website that fails:

> "Unlock the power of AI to revolutionize your search visibility. In today's competitive landscape, businesses need every advantage they can get..."

> 24 words in and I still don't know what they do, where they are, or what they charge.

**[B-ROLL: Fail example with word count overlay, truncation line at 50 words]**

> Here's one that passes:

> "AEO Protocol optimizes brands for ChatGPT and Gemini visibility. We're based in Amsterdam. Pricing starts at $3,000 per month. We've helped 50+ brands increase LLM citations by an average of 340%."

> WHO: AEO Protocol. WHAT: Optimizes for AI. WHERE: Amsterdam. PRICE: $3,000. Plus a proof point.

**[B-ROLL: Pass example with green checkmarks appearing next to WHO/WHAT/WHERE/PRICE]**

**[GIF: "Mind blown" reaction]**

**Mini-Tension**
> Now you might be thinking "Okay, I'll fix my first 50 words. Problem solved."

> Not so fast.

> Because even if your content is perfect, you still don't know if ChatGPT is actually recommending you.

> And testing that? It's more complicated than you think.

---

### Step 3: The 10-Run Consistency Test (5:30 - 7:45)

**Story/Example**
> Remember what I said at the beginning? I ran the same query 10 times and got 10 different answers.

> This is the most important step in the entire audit. And almost nobody does it.

> Watch this.

**[B-ROLL: Live screen recording - running "best hair transplant Europe" in ChatGPT 10 times, showing different results each time]**

> Run 1: Recommends Clinic A, Clinic B, Clinic C.

> Run 2: Recommends Clinic B, Clinic D, Clinic E.

> Run 3: Recommends Clinic A, Clinic C, Clinic F.

> Different answer. Every. Single. Time.

> Now imagine you're a potential customer. You ask ChatGPT for a recommendation. You get Clinic B. You go with Clinic B.

> Meanwhile, Clinic A - who might actually be better - just lost a customer because they happened to lose that particular coin flip.

> This is happening thousands of times a day. And most brands have no idea.

**Framework Explanation**
> This is why I developed the 10-Run Consistency Test.

> For every dream query, I run it 10 times in ChatGPT. And 10 times in Gemini. That's 20 data points per query.

> Then I calculate a consistency score. If your brand appears in 8 out of 10 runs, that's an 80% consistency score. Good.

> If you appear in 2 out of 10? That's a problem. It means you're leaving 80% of potential recommendations on the table.

**[B-ROLL: Spreadsheet showing queries with consistency scores - 8/10, 3/10, 0/10]**

> One client I audited - they showed up in branded queries 100% of the time. Great.

> But discovery queries? "Best in their category?" Zero out of ten. They were invisible to anyone who didn't already know them.

> Think about that. If someone already knew their name, ChatGPT would praise them. But if someone was LOOKING for a solution - total silence. That's a business problem hiding in plain sight.

**Mini-Tension**
> And this brings up an important question.

> If you can only test so many queries, which ones actually matter?

> That's step 4. And it's the one that separates amateurs from professionals.

---

### Step 4: Discovery Query Mapping (7:45 - 9:00)

**Story/Example**
> Here's a mistake I see constantly.

> Brands obsess over their branded queries. "Does ChatGPT know who we are?"

> But your brand name queries don't matter if nobody knows you exist in the first place.

**[B-ROLL: Funnel diagram - Discovery queries at top (wide), Brand queries at bottom (narrow)]**

> Think of it like a funnel. At the top, you have people who don't know any brands yet. They're just searching for solutions. "Best hair transplant in Europe." "Top AI consulting firm." "Premium accounting software."

> That's discovery. That's where the volume is.

> At the bottom, you have people who already know your name. They're comparing you to competitors, reading reviews, checking prices.

> That's brand. That's where you convert.

> But here's the thing - you can't convert people at the bottom if they never found you at the top.

**Framework Explanation**
> So I map queries into two categories.

> Discovery Queries: How people FIND you before they know you exist.
> - "best [category] in [location]"
> - "top [professional type] for [use case]"
> - "premium [category] [region]"

> Brand Queries: How people learn MORE once they've heard of you.
> - "[brand name] reviews"
> - "[brand name] vs [competitor]"
> - "Is [brand name] worth it"

**[B-ROLL: Query map diagram with Discovery queries on left, Brand queries on right, arrows flowing between them]**

> The money is in discovery queries. That's where new customers come from.

> Brand queries just convert people who already found you somewhere else.

> So when I build the query set for an audit, I weight heavily toward discovery. I test 5-7 discovery queries versus 2-3 brand queries. That's where you find the gaps that are actually costing you money.

---

### Step 5: The Playbook Creation (9:00 - 10:00)

**Story/Example**
> So now I have all this data. Dream queries, first 50 words analysis, consistency scores, discovery vs brand breakdown.

> But data without action is just noise.

> That's why every audit I run ends with a Playbook.

**[B-ROLL: Audit document transforming/morphing into a structured playbook]**

**Framework Explanation**
> The Playbook converts findings into prioritized weekly actions.

> Week 1 - Critical: Fix your first 50 words. Target queries where you have 0% visibility.

> Week 2 - High Priority: Create comparison pages. Fix technical issues like robots.txt blocking AI crawlers.

> Month 1 - Medium Priority: Build external citations. Get listed on review platforms. Create content for dream queries you're missing.

**[B-ROLL: Playbook document showing Week 1 / Week 2 / Month 1 sections with tasks]**

> One client went from zero mentions to 8 out of 10 consistency in 30 days. Not because they did everything. Because they did the right things in the right order.

**[GIF: Productive/excited reaction - someone celebrating]**

> The audit tells you what's broken. The playbook tells you how to fix it.

---

### PAYOFF (10:00 - 10:45)

**Resolve Main Tension**
> So let me bring this back to where we started.

> I ran the same query 10 times and got 10 different answers. That's not a bug. That's how LLMs work.

> And if you're testing your visibility with one query, one time - you're gambling with your business.

> The brands that win in AI aren't the ones who check once and hope for the best. They're the ones who test systematically, find the gaps, and fix them in the right order.

**Deliver on Teaser**
> Remember I said step 2 takes 30 seconds and most brands fail it immediately?

> Go read your homepage right now. Count the first 50 words. If you don't see WHO, WHAT, WHERE, and PRICE - you know what to fix first. That alone could change how ChatGPT sees you.

**Circle Back**
> This 5-step system - Intake, First 50, 10-Run Test, Discovery Mapping, Playbook - this is what separates brands that show up in AI from brands that don't.

> It's not complicated. But it is systematic. And systems beat hope every single time.

---

### CTA (10:45 - 11:15)

**One-Sentence Recap**
> If you remember one thing from this video: stop guessing about your AI visibility. Test it properly. 10 runs per query. Focus on discovery. Build a playbook.

**Point to Next Video**
> Now, you've seen the system. But you might be wondering - does it actually work?

> In the next video, I'm going to show you exactly how I used this system to get a hair clinic mentioned in ChatGPT in 30 days. Real client. Real results. Step by step.

**[END SCREEN: Point to "How I Got [Hair Clinic] Mentioned in ChatGPT in 30 Days"]**

**Strong Ending**
> I'll see you in the next one.
