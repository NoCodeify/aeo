HOOK

I was on my second BMW. I loved those cars. I was absolutely certain I was going to buy my third one.

I'd already scaled a hair clinic from zero to five million dollars. Then from five million to ten million. I thought I understood how people made decisions.

But before buying, I made the mistake of asking ChatGPT for advice on what car I should get.

It analyzed my preferences, my budget, my driving style. And it came back with a recommendation I didn't expect - a Porsche Boxster.

I bought the Porsche. And that's when I realized - everything I thought I knew about marketing was wrong. If an AI could change MY buying decision on a car I was certain about, what was it doing to my clients' businesses?

SETUP

Here's what most business owners are doing right now. They're checking their Google rankings. Every day. Sometimes multiple times a day. They're paying SEO agencies thousands of dollars a month to move from position 5 to position 3. They're celebrating when they hit page one.

And I get it. I used to do the same thing. For years, Google rankings were THE metric. If you ranked well, you won. If you didn't, you lost.

But something has fundamentally changed. And most businesses haven't noticed yet. The question is no longer "where do you rank on Google?" The question is "does ChatGPT recommend you?"

Because millions of people are now making buying decisions by asking AI assistants. And those AI assistants don't care about your Google ranking.

POINT 1: THE WAKE-UP CALL

Let me tell you exactly what happened with that Porsche. I'd been a BMW guy for years. Two cars. Loved the brand. Was completely loyal.

But I wanted a second opinion before dropping 35 grand. So I asked ChatGPT. I gave it my preferences - I wanted something fun to drive, good resale value, under a certain budget.

ChatGPT came back and made a case I hadn't considered. It said: "Based on your preferences, you might want to consider a Porsche Boxster. Here's why - better driving dynamics than a comparable BMW, stronger resale value in the used market, and more unique ownership experience."

Now think about what just happened. I didn't Google "Porsche vs BMW." I didn't read review websites. I didn't watch YouTube comparisons. I asked an AI, and the AI recommended a brand.

This is what I call the "AI Recommendation Moment." It's happening millions of times a day, across every industry, for every type of purchase.

But here's where it gets interesting. If you're a car dealer, a hair clinic, a software company, a restaurant - how do you know if ChatGPT is recommending you? How do you know if you're the Porsche in your industry, or the brand that got passed over?

That question changed my entire business. I went from running ads and building funnels to something completely different - making sure my clients are the ones getting recommended.

POINT 2: THE DATA THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING

After the Porsche thing, I couldn't stop thinking about it. If AI changed my decision, what was it doing to my clients? So I went and audited my main project - a premium hair transplant clinic in the Netherlands that I'd helped scale from zero to ten million.

On paper, everything looked great. They ranked number 3 on Google for "best hair transplant Netherlands." Solid SEO. Page one. The kind of result most businesses would celebrate.

But I wanted to know what was happening on the AI side. So I ran what I now call a "10-run consistency test." I asked ChatGPT and Gemini the same discovery queries - ten times each.

Here's what I found. On Google - position 3, consistently. No change. The SEO was working exactly as expected.

But on Gemini? For the most important discovery query - "best hair transplant clinic in the Netherlands" - they weren't mentioned AT ALL. Zero. Invisible.

The clinic I'd spent years building had zero visibility on the exact query potential patients were asking AI assistants.

That's when I realized - Google rankings and AI visibility are two completely different games. You can win one and lose the other. And increasingly, the AI game is the one that matters for high-intent buyers.

So I optimized their content for AI - restructured the website copy, added citable facts in the first 50 words of every page, created comparison pages. Their Google ranking? Stayed exactly the same. Still number 3. But their Gemini visibility went from 0% to 70%. They started getting mentioned consistently.

POINT 3: WHAT I TRACK NOW

So what do I actually look at now instead of Google rankings? Let me show you.

Every week, I run consistency tests for my clients. I ask ChatGPT and Gemini their most important discovery queries - ten times each. And I track four things.

First: Mention Rate. Out of 10 queries, how many times does the brand get mentioned? Anything below 60% means you're being overlooked.

Second: Position. When you ARE mentioned, are you first, third, fifth? Are you positioned as "the best" or just "one option"?

Third: Citation. Does the LLM link back to your website? This tells you if your content is being used as a source.

Fourth: Context. What does the AI say about you? Are they calling you "premium" or "budget"? "Best for hairlines" or "best for volume"? This is your AI reputation.

This is what I call AEO - Answer Engine Optimization. It's the new game. And the brands that figure this out now will dominate for the next decade.

Think about it. Google had 20+ years of SEO best practices. Everyone learned the rules. Everyone competed on the same playing field.

AI search is in year one. The rules are still being written. The businesses that move now get first-mover advantage.

PAYOFF

So, should you stop caring about Google rankings entirely?

Not exactly. Google still drives traffic. SEO still matters. But it's no longer the ONLY thing that matters.

Remember I said the Porsche changed everything? Here's what actually changed: my understanding of WHERE decisions are being made.

When I bought that Boxster, the decision didn't happen on Google. It happened in a conversation with an AI. And that's happening for your customers too.

The question isn't "where do you rank?" anymore. The question is "when someone asks AI about your industry, are you the brand that gets recommended?"

I went from checking Google rankings every morning to not checking them at all. Because I track something more important now - whether my clients show up when AI gives advice.
