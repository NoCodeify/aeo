## A-Roll Shots (Talking Head)

### Shot 1: Hook
**Duration:** 0:00 - 0:45
**Energy Level:** HIGH - Conversational urgency
**Notes:** Start confident but not shouting. The hook is a personal story so energy should feel like you're telling a friend something surprising. Build intensity through the "everything I believed about marketing changed" line.

**Key beats to nail:**
- "I was on my second BMW" - Casual, setting the scene
- "I made the mistake of asking ChatGPT" - Slight smile, knowing what's coming
- "It convinced me to buy a Porsche" - Surprise reveal energy
- "Everything I thought I knew about marketing was wrong" - Land this line with weight

### Shot 2: Setup
**Duration:** 0:45 - 2:30
**Energy Level:** Medium-High
**Notes:** Empathetic, understanding tone. You're describing what "most business owners" do - no judgment, just observation. Build tension toward the "something has fundamentally changed" revelation.

**Key beats to nail:**
- "Every day. Sometimes multiple times a day" - Slight knowing smile
- "I used to do the same thing" - Personal connection
- "The question is no longer where do you rank" - Slow down, emphasis

### Shot 3: Point 1 - The Wake-Up Call
**Duration:** 2:30 - 4:30
**Energy Level:** Medium (storytelling mode)
**Notes:** This is the detailed Porsche story. Take your time. Let the story breathe. Build to the "AI Recommendation Moment" framework reveal.

**Key beats to nail:**
- "Two cars. Loved the brand. Was completely loyal" - Genuine reflection
- "It said: Based on your preferences..." - Slightly slower, like you're remembering
- "This is what I call the AI Recommendation Moment" - Framework reveal, slightly elevated energy

### Shot 4: Point 2 - The Data
**Duration:** 4:30 - 7:00
**Energy Level:** Medium-High (proof mode)
**Notes:** This is where you drop the numbers. Be clear and precise. The 0% to 70% reveal should land with impact. Don't rush through the data. This is YOUR project you're talking about - genuine investment.

**Key beats to nail:**
- "I couldn't stop thinking about it" - Genuine curiosity energy
- "The clinic I'd helped scale from zero to ten million" - Personal stake, not random client
- "Zero. Invisible." - Let this land with weight, slight disbelief
- "Gemini visibility went from 0% to 70%" - Victory energy, proof it can be fixed

### Shot 5: Point 3 - What I Track Now
**Duration:** 7:00 - 9:30
**Energy Level:** Medium (teaching mode)
**Notes:** Clear, methodical explanation of the four metrics. This is the practical "here's what to do" section. Viewers should feel like they're getting real actionable insight.

**Key beats to nail:**
- "Let me show you" - Invitation energy
- "First: Mention Rate. Second: Position..." - Tick through clearly
- "This is what I call AEO" - Framework name reveal
- "The businesses that move now get first-mover advantage" - Build urgency

### Shot 6: Payoff
**Duration:** 9:30 - 11:00
**Energy Level:** Medium-High (resolution)
**Notes:** Bring it full circle. Answer the "should you stop caring?" question with nuance. Return to the Porsche story for the callback. End on a strong, memorable line.

**Key beats to nail:**
- "Not exactly. Google still drives traffic" - Measured, balanced
- "Remember I said the Porsche changed everything?" - Callback energy
- "When someone asks AI about your industry, are you the brand that gets recommended?" - Rhetorical, let it hang

### Shot 7: CTA
**Duration:** 11:00 - 11:30
**Energy Level:** Medium
**Notes:** Clear, direct call to action. Point to next video. Warm but not salesy.

**Key beats to nail:**
- "Google rankings tell you where you rank. AI visibility tells you who gets chosen" - Memorable one-liner
- "Watch this next video" - Direct pointing gesture to where end screen will be
- "I'll see you in the next one" - Warm, genuine sign-off
