**Date Created:** 2026-01-25
**Updated:** 2026-01-30 (Thumbnail style guide applied)
**Target Publish Date:** Week 5
**Video Number:** Week 5 of content calendar

## Video Goal

**Primary Goal:** [X] Views (Growth video - contrarian angle to broaden audience)

**Success Metric:** 3x channel average views, high engagement from SEO-focused viewers who haven't considered AEO

---

## Video Concept

**Title:** "I Stopped Caring About Google Rankings (Here's What Happened)"

**Why this title works:**
- Universal hook: Everyone in business cares about Google rankings
- Contrarian: "I stopped" challenges their assumption
- Curiosity: "Here's What Happened" creates need to click
- Personal story format (Ed's 2.7x pattern)

**Thumbnail Concept:**
- Text: "I TRACK THIS NOW"
- Face/emotion: Relaxed smirk, unbothered
- Visual metaphor: Google logo faded/crossed out, new metric glowing
- Background: Dark navy (#0A1628)
- Text color: White

**1+1=3 Check:**
- Title = what I stopped doing (Google rankings)
- Thumbnail = what I do instead (track something else)
- Together = "He stopped tracking Google and tracks something else now - what is it?"

**Angle:** Personal confession - I used to obsess over Google rankings like everyone else. Then I discovered AI is where buying decisions happen. Now I track something completely different.

**Type:** [X] Contrarian

## Target Audience

**Who is this for:**
- Stage: SEO-focused marketers and business owners spending time/money on rankings
- Problem they have: Obsessing over Google position but not seeing proportional results
- What they've tried: Traditional SEO, content marketing, backlink building

**Why they'll click:** The title challenges their core assumption. If someone stopped caring about rankings and something positive happened, they need to know what.

**Why they'll stay:** The personal story (Porsche), the real data (FueGenix case), and the alternative system they can implement.

## Key Points to Cover

1. **Point 1: The Wake-Up Call (Porsche Story)**
   - Story: I was buying my third BMW. Asked ChatGPT for advice. It convinced me to buy a Porsche. A $50K decision changed by AI.
   - Visual: BMW vs Porsche split screen, ChatGPT interface

2. **Point 2: The Data That Changed Everything (FueGenix Case)**
   - Story: I audited my main project - the hair clinic I'd scaled to $10M. They ranked #3 on Google. But Gemini didn't mention them at all.
   - Visual: Two charts - flat Google ranking vs steep AI visibility climb

3. **Point 3: What I Track Now (The New Game)**
   - Story: Instead of checking Google rankings, I run 10-run consistency tests. Do LLMs mention the brand? How often? In what position?
   - Visual: Dashboard showing consistency scores, mention rates

---

## Proof Elements

**Numbers to share:**
- $50K Porsche purchase decision influenced by ChatGPT
- Client Google ranking: #3 (unchanged)
- Client Gemini visibility: 0% to 70%
- Hair clinic scaled $0 to $5M to $10M (credibility)

**Screenshots/recordings needed:**
- ChatGPT interface recommending Porsche
- ChatGPT/Gemini answering "best hair transplant" queries
- Google SERP showing #3 ranking
- Consistency test results dashboard

---

## CTA Strategy

**Next video to point to:** "If I Had To Rebuild My Business In 2026, I'd Do This First" (Week 6)

**End screen setup:** "Now that you understand WHY Google rankings don't tell the full story, watch this next video where I show you exactly what to do about it."

---

## Production Notes

**B-roll needs:**
- BMW vs Porsche visual
- ChatGPT interface mockup
- Google ranking chart (flat line)
- AI visibility chart (0% to 70% growth)
- Consistency score dashboard
- Old SEO vs New AEO comparison

**GIF moments:**
- After Porsche story reveal (~2:00) - "mind blown"
- After showing Google ranking stayed same (~5:00) - "so what?" shrug
- After showing AI visibility spike (~7:00) - celebration

## Title & Thumbnail Validation (DO NOT SKIP)
