# Video Brief: I Stopped Caring About Google Rankings (Here's What Happened)

**Date Created:** 2026-01-25
**Target Publish Date:** Week 4 (late January 2026)
**Video Number:** Week 4 of content calendar

---

## Video Goal

**Primary Goal:** [X] Views (Growth video - contrarian angle to broaden audience)

**Success Metric:** 3x channel average views, high engagement from SEO-focused viewers who haven't considered AEO

---

## Video Concept

**Title:** "I Stopped Caring About Google Rankings (Here's What Happened)"

**Thumbnail Concept:**
- Face/Emotion: Relaxed/unbothered expression, slight smirk
- Text (3 words max): "RANKINGS DON'T MATTER"
- Visual metaphor: Google logo fading out, AI logos (ChatGPT/Gemini) bright

**Angle:** Personal confession - I used to obsess over Google rankings like everyone else. Then I discovered that AI is where buying decisions happen. Now I track something completely different.

**Type:** [X] Contrarian (2.7x pattern from Ed's data)

---

## Target Audience

**Who is this for:**
- Stage: SEO-focused marketers and business owners spending time/money on rankings
- Problem they have: Obsessing over Google position but not seeing proportional results
- What they've tried: Traditional SEO, content marketing, backlink building

**Why they'll click:** The title challenges their core assumption. If someone stopped caring about rankings and something positive happened, they need to know what.

**Why they'll stay:** The personal story (Porsche), the real data (FueGenix case), and the alternative system they can implement.

## Key Points to Cover

1. **Point 1: The Wake-Up Call (Porsche Story)**
   - Story/example: I was buying my third BMW. Asked ChatGPT for advice. It convinced me to buy a Porsche Boxster instead. A $35K decision changed by AI.
   - Visual metaphor: BMW vs Porsche split screen, ChatGPT interface recommending

2. **Point 2: The Data That Changed Everything (FueGenix Case)**
   - Story/example: After the Porsche realization, I audited my own main project - the hair clinic I'd scaled to $10M. They ranked #3 on Google for "best hair transplant Netherlands" - great SEO. But when I ran consistency tests, Gemini didn't mention them at all for discovery queries. Google ranking stayed the same. AI visibility went from 0% to 70% after optimization.
   - Visual metaphor: Two charts - flat Google ranking line vs steep AI visibility climb

3. **Point 3: What I Track Now (The New Game)**
   - Story/example: Instead of checking Google rankings, I run 10-run consistency tests. I track: Do LLMs mention the brand? How often? In what position? With what context? This is AEO.
   - Visual metaphor: Dashboard showing consistency scores, mention rates, citation tracking

## Proof Elements

**Numbers to share:**
- $35K Porsche purchase decision influenced by ChatGPT
- Client Google ranking: #3 (unchanged throughout)
- Client Gemini visibility: 0% to 70% for discovery queries
- Hair clinic scaled $0 to $5M to $10M (credibility)
- 10-run consistency test methodology

**Screenshots/recordings needed:**
- ChatGPT interface recommending Porsche (recreation or example)
- ChatGPT/Gemini answering "best hair transplant" queries (before/after)
- Google SERP showing #3 ranking
- Consistency test results dashboard

**Client examples:**
- FueGenix Hair Clinic - your own project you scaled $0->$10M (can reference as "premium hair clinic in Netherlands")

---

## CTA Strategy

**Next video to point to:** "The EXACT System To Get Your Brand Recommended by ChatGPT" (Week 5)

**End screen setup:** Point directly to Week 5 video. Setup line: "Now that you understand WHY Google rankings don't tell the full story, watch this next video where I show you THE EXACT SYSTEM to get your brand recommended by ChatGPT and Gemini."

---

## Production Notes

**B-roll needs:**
- BMW vs Porsche visual (AI-generated)
- ChatGPT interface mockup
- Google ranking chart (flat line)
- AI visibility chart (0% to 70% growth)
- Consistency score dashboard
- Old SEO vs New AEO comparison

**GIF moments:**
- After Porsche story reveal (~2:00) - "mind blown" reaction
- After showing Google ranking stayed same (~5:00) - "so what?" shrug
- After showing AI visibility spike (~7:00) - celebration/surprise

**Special requirements:**
- Screen recordings of actual ChatGPT/Gemini responses
- May need to anonymize client data (use "premium clinic" framing)

## Title & Thumbnail Validation (DO NOT SKIP)

**Title Options (generate 3-5, kill-list filter, pick winner):**

1. "I Stopped Caring About Google Rankings (Here's What Happened)" - WINNER
2. "Why I Stopped Checking Google Rankings (And What I Track Instead)"
3. "Google Rankings Don't Matter Anymore (Here's Proof)"
4. "I Quit Obsessing Over SEO (This Happened)"
5. "The Day I Stopped Caring About Google (A Confession)"

**Winner:** "I Stopped Caring About Google Rankings (Here's What Happened)"

**Title Checklist:**
- [X] Speaks to THEIR problem (obsessing over rankings)
- [X] Creates curiosity gap (what happened? need to click)
- [X] Has specificity (Google rankings - concrete)
- [X] Passes scroll test (controversial statement demands attention)
- [X] Zero kill-list matches (no "I use", no jargon, not process-focused)
- [ ] Contains ChatGPT/Gemini/AI - NOT directly, but AI is the payoff

**Note on positioning keyword:** Title doesn't contain ChatGPT/Gemini directly, but this is intentional for a GROWTH video. The contrarian hook ("stopped caring about rankings") is the draw. AI is revealed as the answer. This follows Ed's contrarian pattern (2.7x).

**Thumbnail Checklist:**
- [X] 3 words max ("RANKINGS DON'T MATTER" or "I STOPPED CHECKING")
- [X] Creates emotion (relief, provocation, curiosity)
- [X] Your face with clear emotion (relaxed/unbothered)
- [X] Visual metaphor present (fading Google logo)
- [X] Text complements title (doesn't repeat "Google Rankings")
- [X] Passes mute test (unbothered face + fading Google = curiosity)

**Gut check:** Show title+thumbnail to someone outside your niche. Do they want to click? [X] Yes - the contrarian statement about ignoring something "everyone" cares about creates instant curiosity.
