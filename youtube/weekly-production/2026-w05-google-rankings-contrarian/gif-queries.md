## Selection Criteria

When choosing the final GIF for each moment:

1. **Professional enough** - Would you show this in a business meeting?
2. **Not overused** - Avoid the most cliche options (no "mind = blown" with literal explosion)
3. **Clear emotion** - The feeling should read instantly
4. **Good loop** - Smooth looping works better than jarring cuts
5. **Appropriate duration** - 2-3 seconds ideal, avoid long GIFs
6. **Resolution quality** - Avoid pixelated or low-quality GIFs
