## About

Hi, I'm Sohaib.

I started building with Claude Code in 2025.

By 2026 I'd built an entire business infrastructure with it - a $100K/yr SaaS, agentic CI/CD pipelines, a consulting delivery system, and an NFC smart lock.

Now I set up Claude Code systems for agency owners, consultants, and business owners so they can do the same.

All you need is a business with repeatable workflows and a Claude Code subscription.

I do done-with-you Claude Code implementation. In 2 weeks you'll have custom agents, automated workflows, and a CLAUDE.md that makes Claude Code understand your business.

What I've built (the portfolio that IS the pitch):

1) DMChamp - a SaaS generating $100K/yr in real revenue. Real customers, real MRR. Maintained by an agentic CI/CD pipeline where bugs get detected, fixed, and the customer gets notified automatically. Human QA only.

2) A full consulting delivery system - custom AI agents, automated workflows, and API integrations powering a complete client pipeline. One system runs an entire consulting engagement.

3) An NFC smart lock - battery-less hardware where the phone charges the lock via NFC, authenticates, and unlocks. Not just software. Claude Code built the firmware.

4) A video production pipeline, cold outreach system, and marketing automation stack. All connected, all automated.

5) FueGenix - took a premium brand from invisible to globally recommended by ChatGPT and Gemini. Built the entire audit and optimization infrastructure with Claude Code.

What a done-with-you setup looks like:

1. Audit your workflows (what you do daily/weekly)
2. Build your custom CLAUDE.md (Claude Code learns your business)
3. Create 3-5 custom agents for your specific workflows
4. Set up your project structure, skills, and slash commands
5. 2x 90-minute live sessions (screen-share, build together)
6. 30 days of async support
