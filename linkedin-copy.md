## About

Hi, I'm Sohaib.

I started building with Claude Code in 2025.

By 2026 I'd built an entire business infrastructure with it - a $100K/yr SaaS, automated client delivery pipelines, and even hardware firmware for a smart lock.

Now I set up Claude Code for agency owners, consultants, and business owners so they can automate the work that eats their time.

All you need is a business with repeatable workflows.

I do done-with-you setups. In 2 weeks you'll have AI handling the stuff you used to do manually - client onboarding, reporting, content, internal operations, whatever your bottleneck is.

What I've built:

1) DMChamp - a SaaS doing $100K/yr. Real customers, real recurring revenue. Bugs get detected and fixed automatically. Customers get notified. I barely touch it.

2) A full consulting delivery system - client intake, project tracking, deliverables, and reporting. One system runs an entire engagement start to finish.

3) An NFC smart lock - the phone charges the lock, authenticates, and unlocks. Not just software. Claude Code built the firmware too.

4) A video production pipeline, cold outreach system, and marketing automation stack. All connected.

5) FueGenix - took a premium brand from invisible to globally recommended by ChatGPT and Gemini. Built the entire system behind it with Claude Code.

What a done-with-you setup looks like:

1. I audit your workflows - what you do daily and weekly
2. I build a system where Claude Code understands your business
3. I create custom AI workflows for your specific bottlenecks
4. We do 2x 90-minute live sessions where we build it together
5. You get 30 days of support after
